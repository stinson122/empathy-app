Every time i get a facial, it gets removed. However, it just comes back. After a month of using this, my cheek bumps are gone. \n\n(I used to use celeteque only)\n\nDefinitely try this! ",

          "If you suspect that it's fungal acne, then there's a possibility that you're right. The ingredient responsible for it isn't one of the ingredients it markets, it's the piroctone olamine in the formulation which is an antifungal ingredient (and I assume its intended function is to be a preservative talaga hahaha). This ingredient is also used in some of the anti-dandruff shampoos.\n\nLauric acid being the 2nd ingredient maybe helps to a certain extent but its antifungal activity isn't well-documented kasi eh, though it's been proven na may antibacterial properties talaga siya.",

          "OP!!!! SANA MASARAP ULAM MO EVERYDAY!!! Almost two weeks ko na tong gamit and 2x na ko nagisotretinoin due to mild -severe acne. Kuminis naman pero after a few months bumalik Yung sa chin ko na maliliit na bumps and blackheads. Nagprescription adapalene ako for months ulit but to no avail. Papabalik na sana ulit Ako for my 3rd try sa isotret kaso nagkasakit ako and I was forced to just accept Yung skin ko muna because I have other chronic Illnesses which needed to be addressed asap. I just saw your post Dito sa reddit and I tried it! Yan lang then micellar ng Nivea din na dati ko nang gamit then vanicream moisturizer. Pansin ko first few days Sabi ko nagstop Yung paggrow ng bumps na bago then until umiimpis na sya. Now, Yung mga acne marks ko nalang prob ko and like bilang na bumps nalang natitira and feeling ko pawala na din. I have an extremely sensitive skin sa face na anything na ilagay ko nagbbreakouts agad ako pero eto hindi. Thank youuuuu OP! 🥺😘",
          "Sakto ubos na yung facial wash ko po. Thanks for the reco! 🫶🏼",
          "I'm also using this, paired with the same Nivea Skin Clear Toner. So far, gusto ko yung effect niya. Hindi makati sa face, gentle lang for me. Not too strong din ang scent."

        "content": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea.

It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\". The tinted version is not fungal-safe.\n\n+ Ekran Soft Spf 50+ PA+++ Silicone Sunscreen Gel\n\n+ CeraVe AM SPF 30 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Heliocare Advanced Gel SPF 50 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Kiko Cosmetics Daily Protection BB Cream SPF 30\n\n+ Banana Boat Baby Tear Free Sunscreen Lotion Spf 50+ Pa++++ (water-based)\n\n+ Banana Boat Simply Protect Kids SPF 50+ PA++++ (water-based mineral sunscreen)\n\n+ Sandiva One & Done Tinted Sunblock SPF35 PA++++ (purely mineral - contains 24%Zinc oxide, and iron oxides.

        "title": "Best Products for Common Skin Concerns Series: OILY SKIN and ACNE",
        "content": "Second in my series aimed at compiling recommendations offered from members of the AB community for addressing common skin concerns. If you missed it, the first of the series can be found here: [ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped.\nI have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for acne isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** *What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with cystic and comedonal acne and breakouts. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time.*\n\n*IF YOU HAVE A FEVER, SEVERE HEADACHE OR NECK STIFFNESS, EYE IRRITATION, LIP OR OTHER FACIAL SWELLING, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.*\n\n**For those of you experiencing hormonal outbreaks**, its important to communicate this with your healthcare provider. Hormonal acne may be a sign of other endocrine/hormonal issues that should be evaluated by a medical professional. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues of hormonal imbalance.\n\n**Another Note:** This list proved quite difficult to compile, given that many contributors with oily/acne-prone skin are using multiple actives and/or retinoids to treat their skin. As such, many use products to restore a depleted moisture barrier that may prove far too heavy for someone with oily skin who is NOT using these treatments. I strongly urge use of this list merely as a starting point, and advise looking at the original threads for additional details. In the meantime, I do plan on doing a separate post for \"tretface,\" overexfoliation, or an otherwise damaged moisture barrier, so stay tuned!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n*Cleansers*\n\n* It's Skin Green Tea Calming Cleansing Oil\n\n* Kose Softmymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n\n* Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil - note that some users experienced breakouts from use of this product; as always, patch test and check ingredient lists for known sensitivities before use\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero Purity\n\n* Shu Uemura Brightening Cleansing Oil (blue bottle) \n\n* The Face Shop Rice Cleansing Oil \n\n* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming cleanser\n\n* Hada Labo ES Foaming cleanser\n\n* COSRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser\n\n* Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash Cleanser \n\n* Acwell 5.5 Bubble-Free pH Balancing Cleanser \n\n* * Himalaya Neem Gel Cleanser\n\n* **Cerave Foaming Face Wash**\n\n* Derma-E Hydrating Cleanser\n\n* Bifesta Cleansing Lotion Moist\n\n*Actives*\n\n* Read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3cgyyr/what_is_your_actives_routine/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4r8bpx/how_do_you_schedule_acidsactives_in_your_routine/) for more about how to incorporate actives into your AB routine\n\n* OST Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum \n\n* COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Clear Up 8% AHA Gel\n\n* **COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid**\n\n* Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel \n\n* Stridex Maximum Strength - BHA\n\n* Spironolactone - women with hormonal acne only, oral, RX\n\n* **Curology** - RX, tele-dermatology service to address acne or aging, with semi-tailored skin cream often containing a trio of ingredients, often including tretinoin, azaleic acid, clindamycin, zinc, niacinamide, vitamin C.

It's better to look at acne in an overall general improvement kind of way, rather than all or nothing, otherwise you are going to feel like you're failing constantly (u/TrishBrennan) \n\n* Make sure to rule out dehydration/compromised moisture barrier as the cause of your acne. Acne can be caused by many things (diet, allergy, hormones, even fungus!) but the easiest version to cure is the one caused by dehydrated, overworked skin. (u/Daheep)\n\n* Be careful to avoid overexfoliation, which can make your acne worse. Many acne patients, especially those familiar with the classic Western medical approach to acne can be over-exuberant with their exfoliators, leading to a compromised moisture barrier, which can lead to more reactive skin. The AB (and in many ways, SCA) approach is far more gentle, aiming to treat acne-prone skin with hydration and only using as much exfoliation as necessary. \n\n* **Stop all other actives when starting prescription acne treatments,** namely chemical exfoliants or any other potentially irritating parts of your routine.\n\n* Make sure you have a solid base routine with a good moisturizer before starting prescription treatment, as many prescriptions can rapidly and drastically deplete your moisture barrier. **A healthy moisture barrier is critical to clear skin.**\n\n* Sometimes it's not about ADDING something, but about ELIMINATING an offending ingredient. Try to identify what products and ingredients help your skin and which seem to make it worse. Sometimes acne can actually be irritation in disguise.\n\n* If starting a retinoid/rx medication/AHA, **USE SUNSCREEN**\n\n* Many ABers will swear by techniques and approaches that may seem counter-intuitive to the unintitiated, such as using oil cleansers as a first step, applying facial oils, and moisturizing the skin. People with oily skin general fear oils in most of their forms, so it can be difficult to feel comfortable applying oils to the face or moisturizing creams. That feeling is normal, feel free to try different suggestions and techniques depending on comfort level, but try to keep an open mind. \n\n* Check your make up application tools (brushes, Beauty Blender) - these may be a source of bacteria and mold that could be at the route of your skin problems. Make sure you wash these tools thoroughly and regularly and let dry completely between uses.\n\n* Sanitize your cell phone\n\n* Change your pillow case twice a week or use a t-shirt over your pillow\n\n* Use new face towel every day\n\n* Avoid picking or touching your face (hydrocolloid patches can help with this)\n\n* Practice positive affirmations\n\n* If you want to truly mimic how they do things in Korea, go see a dermatologist, especially one that specializes in aesthetic dermatology. Koreans are much more likely to see a dermatologist for even minor breakouts. Of course, accessibility and affordability are an issue for many, so of course, this may be easier said than done. \n\n* Get some sleep already!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDITORIAL COMMENT** This is the topic that is probably covered the most thoroughly here on Reddit, giving that the demographic likely skews younger. After reading through thousands of comments and posts on this topic, the major takeaway for the AB approach to acne is to use an Asian-style routine (double cleansing, multiple hydrating layers, gentle approach, use of whitening/brightening products that also have anti-inflammatory effects) in conjunction with prescription medications. Retinoid based treatments can be very harsh on the skin's moisture barrier, and lucky for those of us who are AB enthusiasts, we have multiple tools at our disposal to replenish lost hydration and provide the necessary occlusion to keep that moisture in the skin. While you can of course try maxing out your OTC exfoliation, the fastest route to clear skin is very likely going to be to see a dermatologist, and then using your AB routine to deal with the aftermath. **Many, many respondents have said that the single most effective change that cleared their acne was seeing a dermatologist**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Sources*\n\n[Acne prone ABers: What product has made the biggest difference in your acne](https://m.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/40rry9/acne_prone_abers_what_product_has_made_the/?ref=search_posts)\n\n[HG Products for Acne Scares Combination Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4f5u65/holy_grail_products_for_acne_scares_combination/)\n\n[What do Koreans use for acne?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4eew3q/what_do_koreans_use_for_acne/)\n\n[AB for Acne Prone Skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3aehm0/asian_beauty_for_acneprone_dry_skin/)\n\n[For oily and acne-prone: do you use moisturizing toners?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4immov/for_oily_and_acne_prone_do_you_use_moisturizing/)\n\n[What's best for acne prone skin?

        "title": "Dollar Tree favorites! (And not-so-favorites) w/ science backed ingredients",
        "content": "I’ve been shopping Dollar Tree beauty for the last couple years, but never had a place to post my finds! It’s great to finally have a community only dedicated to Dollar Tree beauty products. Hurray for the appreciation for these items! \n\nHere’s some old (may not be able to find) and newer products that I’ve enjoyed and recommend. With some other products I’m less enthusiastic about but think some may still find useful for a short review. \n\n**For some background**: I’ve followed the videos and content of dermatologist Dr Dray (who visits Dollar Tree saying what’s good—she recommended the Kissable Foot Cream for instance). as well as watched a lot of skincare research videos by the two cosmetic chemists of [Chemist Confessions](https://youtube.com/@chemistconfessions?si=UOUzd8RbKlnA6VrE). Highly recommend their often very in-depth videos by the way (clinical research studies!). They are very fun and educational to watch! \n\nWith this background in mind, I’ve shopped Dollar Tree beauty with a mind on trying out interesting and effective ingredients on a budget. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, acne prone, dehydrated. Some dryness during winter and with overuse of actives. \n\n##Miscellaneous health & beauty: \n\n_Medicine_\n* **Valu Health Non-drowsy daytime cold & flu/nighttime cold & flu acetaminophen soft gels** - As good as DayQuil/NyQuil for fever and cold. Excellent for travel. Conveniently color coded orange (daytime) and green (nighttime). \n\n_Toothpaste_\n* **Colgate Complete Protection Sensitive** - Pleasant mild mint perhaps similar to Sensodyne or Trident Spearmint gum. 5% potassium nitrate calmed my intense tooth aches before seeing dentist. In fact my dentist gave me just this toothpaste before. Tip: Use for two weeks before applying tooth whitening strips or gel to reduce sensitivity. \n\n_Deodorant:_\n* **Suave deodorant energizing sport** - Has aluminum (chemically blocks sweat). Works for summer body odor. Masculine scent. Can leave white marks on dark clothes. \n\n##Body wash, shampoo, hand soap:\n\n_Body wash_\n* **Arm & Hammer Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash** - Best consistency of the Dollar Tree body washes I’ve tried. Not runny; a regular gel. The unisex scents appeals to whole family but men especially. \n* **Power Stick Shower Gel Santal Woods** - Too runny. But nice smell. “Santal” means sandalwood but I also smelled cedarwood. Like Bath and Body Works Cedarwood Sauna perhaps. Unisex; appeals to men. \n\n_Shampoo_\n* **Pro Silk Moisturizing Shampoo Moroccan Argan and Coconut Oil** - Too runny. Builds up over time. Will need a clarifying shampoo with it. Appreciate the extra large 32 oz value size. \n* I generally like V05 or Suave for clarifying shampoo if they come with sulfates. \n\n_Hand soap:_\n* **Dermasil Extra Moisturizing Hand Wash** - Moisturizing and silky like Dove hand soap. A subtle cherry almond scent. \n* **Soft Soap Milk and Honey** - Moisturizing and gentle on hands. Pleasant, mild scent. \n* **Dial Moisturizing Hand Soap Vanilla Honey** - Similar to Soft Soap. Gentle on hands as promised. My dentist’s office uses a similar one. This is not antibacterial but antibacterial hand soap is not needed for most people and actually can lead to bacteria gaining resistance against cleaning agents. Pleasant, mild scent. \n\n##Body care \n\n_Body balms:_\n* **Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly** - Apply on minor cuts and bruises to help prevent scarring. Use occasionally in skincare for an extra occlusive layer (“slugging”). Daily overuse can make skin lazy though. Alternatively try Aquaphor, Cerave ointment or a face oil. Slight waxy smell. \n* **Xtra Care Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick** - Very firm, drags. But is unscented and not the worst.\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Treatment Foot Cream** - 1% Dimethicone (similar to La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5) and 30% petrolatum. More of a healing balm than a lotion. Stiff textured. But has effective strengths of active ingredients. Fragrance free. \n\n_Body lotion:_\n* **Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion** - An excellent body lotion similar to Vaseline Intensive Care. A bit more fluid. Not as fluid as Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion but also more moisturizing. Simple ingredients (no ceramides), no irritants, fragrance free. \n* **Xtra Care Diabetics’ Hydrating Lotiom Dry Skin Relief** - Similar to the above Kissable Diabetics’ Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Simple ingredients, fragrance free, nice texture. Note: Was **recalled** once. \n* **Dermasil Eczema Relief Body Lotion** - Good consistency. Some soothing plant extracts and oat extract (but not to active ingredient levels). Has graveolens oil for fragrance. Imparts a sweet, herbal, earthy scent like chamomile. Liked ok. \n\n_Hand cream:_\n* **Care All Creamy Petroleum Jelly** - 30% petrolatum. An excellent hand cream much thicker than Vaseline Intensive Care, great for dry winter hands. But does smell _intensely_ like baby powder. 30% petrolatum functions as a skin protectant similar to the 40% petrolatum in Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment. \n* **Udderly Smooth Hand Cream Original Formula** - The fastest absorbing hand cream I’ve found! Impressed a nurse friend. Was developed to quickly moisturize chapped cow udders. \n\n##Face products \n\n_Face cleanser & cold cream:_\n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash** - Very good, non-stripping formula with gentle but effective cocamidopropyl betaine (coconut derived). Have used both day and night. Tea tree oil can have an anti-acne effect similar to benzoyl peroxide. Perhaps can leave on skin like a mask before washing off? Does not state percentage of ingredients so assume the salicylic acid is below 1%. \n* **B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream** - Dislike this formula and intense powdery scent. But does work surprisingly well as a cold cream cleansing balm to remove makeup. \n\n_Face lotion, eye cream:_\n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Eye Cream**, 0.5 oz - excellent silky smooth consistency like a more expensive serum. Has peptides but can’t say I noticed an effect. Squalane is the most non-comedogenic of oils \n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream (jar)**, 1.7 oz - the same as the eye cream in consistency but more product! Similar ingredients such as peptides and squalane too. Topical collagen is not really helpful in skincare as the molecules are too large to reach the dermis, the deep layer of the skin. Better to use a retinol, vitamin C, or to drink a collagen supplement. \n\n_Face serum:_\n* *^Skin Nutrition Botanicals Niacinamide 5% + Squalane Serum** - Truly excellent value! 5% niacinamide is quickly becoming the new industry standard for niacinamide as consumers learn that more does not equal better with this ingredient. 5% is the maximum recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic chemists these days, and even The Ordinary has followed suit. Niacinamide at this strength can help minimize large pores, strengthen skin barrier and help with hyperpigmentation as a supplementary active to a higher strength one and a chemical exfoliant (it takes a shotgun approach to deal with stubborn hyperpigmentation!). Most Skin Nutrition Botanicals serums are similar, but this one stands out because of its slightly cloudy, jelly texture due to the rice ferment filtrate and squalane. Reminds me of Korean skincare. \n* Have tried other Skincare Nutrition Botanicals serums such as the 1% vitamin C (ascorbyl glucoside; vitamin c derivative usually found between 2-5%, and up to 12%) and double retinol. Same gel serum consistency. Nice as serums. Not sure I noticed results. But others who have used them longer (especially the retinol) say they have. \n\n_Lips:_\n* **Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips** - A made in Korea product, and does have a nicer feel. Thin, jelly texture similar to Nivea lip balm. Supposed to have a tint but is pretty much colorless. Love the scent: like a natural rose, but in a pleasant, non-perfumey way. Not as moisturizing as Aquaphor but not drying either. Also: the large pull off cap is amazing for slippery, just-applied-my-skincare hands. \n* I am interested in the lip spf products. Used to think spf 15 was too low but I heard that you want to apply lip SPF more frequently anyway since it wears off the most (eating, drinking, talking). I’ll check out some more. \n\n##Limited products \n\nI have also tried and liked other Dollar Tree one-off products from better brands clearing out products such as ^^Lumin, Derma Geek, Ouidad Twist** hair conditioner, etc. My favorite is Lumin (face moisturizer in either oily or dry skin variants: citronnel scent similar to Belif moisturizer, and a similar Korean skincare feel like snail mucin infused product, except meadowsweet oil) and Derma Geek (gentle cleanser, night moisturizer with niacinamide).",

          "Have repurchased:\n\n* The cold and flu capsules \n* Colgate sensitive toothpaste \n* Skin Nutrition Botanicals 5% niacinamide + squalane.\n* Global Beauty Care collagen eye cream/skin cream. \n\nWould repurchase: \n\n* Pretty much all, except I’m always trying new products so I’m usually moving on to the next thing. \n* I’d get the deodorant since it’s travel size, but a different scent. \n\nWould not repurchase:\n\n* B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream - I just don’t like the scent. Also the product was too fluid for the jar and leaked a bit when on its side. But, I think it does work as a cold cream cleaning balm in a pinch. \n* Pro Silk shampoo - maybe I’d get it again because of the value size. But it’s just not my favorite texture (runny). \n* Xtracare revitalizing body balm - didn’t really have a need for it. Thought I could use it for thigh chafing but I think it’s probably too stiff in texture to glide well. Didn’t try. \n* On this note I did try a gel stick again anyway, which I reviewed this week: [LA Splash Soothing and Cooling Stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/dollartreebeauty/s/yAX1l7nNnv). Yes it glides better but still drags compared to skipping on a regular serum. Works better with a toner for extra skip. I still feel like I don’t really need this product. And the fragrance makes it less versatile too.",

The villains and fails were booted out a few weeks ago (examples - Minimalist Sepicalm, Pond's Super Light Gel, Mcaffeine Under Eye Cream, Plum Chamomile mask)\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nFirst cleansers and makeup removers\n\n* *Plum E-Luminence Simply Supple Cleansing Balm* (10g mini, from Smytten) : Takes off makeup effectively. Waterproof eye makeup requires a bit more effort (and it kinda stings my eyes when I wash it off). Removes sunscreen well. WRP.\n* *Garnier Skin Naturals Micellar Cleansing Water* (125 ml, MRP Rs.199, but purchased from Amazon for Rs.150) : With a couple of cotton pads and a little bit extra effort, it removes even waterproof makeup (probably because my oily skin has already broken it down nicely). Stings my eyes a bit. But does its job. WRP.\n* *Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E* (200ml, MRP Rs.165, purchased from local supermarket) : Relatively inexpensive and effective oil cleanser. Doesn't emulsify with water. Pulls out sebaceous filaments so well. No adverse reaction (had a bad experience with pure almond oil). WRP.\n\nSecond and standalone cleansers\n\n* *Bioderma Sebium Gel Moussant Purifying Cleansing Foaming Gel* (45 ml mini, from Smytten) : Love it, removes sunscreen by itself. Non-drying and skin feels very clean. I like using this during hormonal acne breakouts. I hear it hasn't been seen on Smytten trials for quite a while now. I got a full size in a care package, but I don't think I'll RP with my own money, too expensive (Rs.395/45 ml). I'd like to try the cheaper pink tube before deciding if I'll ever repurchase.\n* *The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash* (250 ml, MRP Rs.745, from The Body Shop store in a mall) : I've been using this for ages, no complaints, except that it doesn't feel very comfortable to use when the barrier is compromised. Now that there are so many new cleansers I'd like to try, WNRP. Also, it lasts for sooo long, even with two people using it. A little bit goes a long way really.\n* *Lever Ayush Anti Pimple Turmeric Face Wash* (150g, MRP Rs. 162) : Underrated af. Cleanses so well without drying my skin. Requires a slightly larger quantity to remove sunscreen. Works so well, sometimes I wonder why I bother with other cleansers. WRP. This is my favourite travel cleanser.\n* *Ahaglow S Foaming Face Wash* (60ml, MRP Rs. 474 ) : I like using this on days I skip exfoliants. Nice clean feeling without it being too drying. WRP.\n\n**Serums**\n\n* *One Thing Centella Asiatica Extract* (150 ml, MRP Rs.1050, from Limese Connect) : Very thin, watery. No added fragrance, slight alcohol smell. I apply it to freshly cleansed skin. Sinks in quickly. So soothing and lovely. I've decanted about 20 ml of it into another serum bottle and I keep it refrigerated.  I used to look up cica / centella asiatica products and sob inwardly after looking at the price tag. Haha not anymore !! Soothes both fresh breakouts and ones in the post extraction healing stage. HG. WRP.\n* *Minimalist 10% Niacinamide + Zinc Face Serum* (30 ml, MRP Rs. 599, from Be Minimalist website) : I used some code to get it for 15% off. This is my second bottle. Works better than the Derma Co niacinamide serum. No complaints, but my bf says it's irritating when applied to shaved skin. It goes well under sunscreen and makeup. I typically use it 3-4x a week, mostly in the AM. But whenever I use it in the PM, it is in combination with salicylic acid. WNRP tho (because I have purchased One Thing Niacinamide - review forthcoming !)\n* *Minimalist Tranexamic 3% + HPA* (30 ml, MRP Rs. 649, from Foxy) : This is my second bottle. Foxy had a nice promotion going on so I got it for Rs.486. This works so well on acne scars and hyperpigmentation. There's a noticeable improvement after 2 months of consistent usage. I don't layer this with any other active. HG. WRP.\n* *Paulas Choice-SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant* (30 ml, MRP Rs.900, from Amazon) : Watery, slightly oily finish. Sinks in, takes a minute. I use this 3-4x a week whenever I have acne breakouts (usually hormonal). I layer it over niacinamide serum sometimes. Acne dies more quickly and blackheads on my nose have reduced. I wish it was a dropper or pump bottle. Definitely better than minimalist's salicylic acid. WRP.\n* *Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Serum +* ( 30ml, MRP Rs.1850, from Maccaron) : first, a disclaimer - this is my second bottle, both were gifted to me by friends. While I am quite fond of it, I will not repurchase it with my own money. This is my go-to lazy day serum, on days I really don't feel like doing any skincare. I just wash my face and put this on. It is somewhat hydrating, and gives me a nice glow. Takes some time to sink in fully. Nothing extraordinary. This is the first Vitamin C product I've used (the actual percentage of Vitamin C in this is not very clear). WNRP.\n* *PULP Day After Binge Superfood Day Serum 20% Vitamin C  with Ferulic Acid* (30ml, MRP Rs.1095, from Pulp website) : I got it for Rs.600ish from the website, some sort of Diwali sale. It has LAA. I was scared of nuking my barrier, so I mix it with moisturiser before applying. I never experienced any tingling, not even while patch testing on multiple spots. I've used it about a dozen times now and I love it so far. Glowy, even a little bit plump. Might be HG, considering I haven't purged (yet ?) and skin looks quite nice. WRP ( I wish my repurchase window coincides with a nice sale hehe) .\n\n**Acne patches**\n\n* *COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch (24 patches, thick) and COSRX Clear Fit Master Patch (18 patches,thin)* (from Maccaron and Beautybarn, MRP Rs.280) : Honestly, I don't feel there's a difference between the two, performance wise. The thiiner one is better suited for wearing makeup, otherwise the choice is based on the size of the pimple. Has never disappointed. WRP. HG.\n* *The Face Shop Dr.Belmeur Clarifying Spot Patch Kit* (Rs. 790, The Face Shop Website) : I got it on a BOGO offer, will RP only if there's a similar offer. The kit consists of two kinds of patches - a hydrocolloid patch pack like COSRX, which works just as well, and a plaster patch pack, which is a thin, plasticky non-absorbent cover meant to be used after using the hydrocolloid patch. It is supposed to be soothing, but it just slid around my face before falling off.\n\n**Under Eye products**\n\n* *Garnier Skin Naturals Light Complete Eye Roll On* (MRP Rs. 189) : I keep it refrigerated. I use it 3-4x throughout the day. Works beautifully. Depuffs, and cools the skin. I've noticed that it also kinda lightens my dark circles, but I've been using it for years now. I've been using this for years now and beats every other under eye product I've ever used. No oily feeling, watery, sinks in a minute or two. HG, WRP.\n* *Kaya Hydro Replenish Under Eye Cream* (I think they've stopped producing this, haven't seen this anywhere for a while now) : Simple, no frills eye under cream, gel like consistency. Sinks in well. I'd RP, but can't find it anywhere now.\n\n**Clay Masks and Pore Strip**\n\n* *Himalaya Herbals Oil Clear Mud Pack* (100g, MRP Rs. 135) : Simple, effective. I've been using this for years. Doesn't dry my skin out too much. WRP.\n* *Eunyul Clean & Fresh Intensive Hydrating Clay Mask Pouch Pack - Skin Refining and Clarifying* and *Eunyul Clean & Fresh Pure Brightening Clay Mask Pouch Pack - Nourishing and Glow Boosting* : disclaimer - I got it in a care package, not sure where it was purchased from and how much it costs. Honestly, I couldn't tell them both apart, similar performance. Used both before wedding related events. Skin felt brighter and softer compared to the Himalaya clay mask, but I'm guessing this is several times as expensive. Ah well, a nice little treat, like a sheet mask, except I got three uses out of each pouch.\n* *Miniso Deep Cleansing Pore Strip* : I know pore strips aren't very kind to the skin, but using this once every 2-3 months has worked out very well for me. These Miniso ones are MUCH better and gentler than the HipHop brand ones. HG, WRP.\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\n* *Physiogel Hypoallergenic Calming Relief A.I. Lotion* (100ml, MRP Rs. 476) : Best moisturizer I have used so far. No adverse reactions. Feels calming, hydrates and moisturises. Sinks in, takes around 2 minutes. Slightly greasy after a few hours, but nothing blotting paper can't fix. HG, WRP.\n* *Disguise Cosmetics CC Sorbet Lotion* (50ml, Rs.400) : Its nice, light but refreshing fragrance. No adverse reactions. Sinks in well, not too greasy later. WNRP because it is overpriced for what it does. Will buy only if there's a really good discount.\n\n**Pre Suncreen and Sunscreens**\n\n* *Kaya Youth Skin Relief Pre Mask Face Gel* (50g, MRP Rs.499) : disclaimer - I got it in a care package, but I will RP if it goes on discount. I apply it after all the serums have sunk in, and follow it up with a sunscreen after a few minutes. Noticeably helped reduce maskne. I feel it is a bit overpriced though. Strongly fragranced for some reason.\n* *Reequil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA* (50g, MRP Rs. 695) : I've only purchased it while it is on discount. On my second tube. HG, WRP. Don't feel like experimenting. Works like a primer for my makeup, so that's convenient. No pilling, blends well, not much of a whitecast (i'm somewhat wheatish toned).\n* *Lacto Calamine Daily Sunshield Matte Look Sunscreen SPF 50 PA +++* (50g, MRP Rs.349) : I like this, I use it on my neck and arms. Not too bad on the face, but requires a good amount of blending and leaves mild pinkish tint that goes away in a while. WRP. Great for the price.\n* *NIVEA Sun Lotion, SPF 50, with UVA & UVB Protection, Water Resistant Sunscreen* (75ml, MRP Rs. 360) : I take this along with me on outdoor sport / hiking / beach trip days. Awful white cast, pills, but it is relatively cheaper so I simply wipe off with micellar water and reapply as needed without feeling too guilty.\n\n**Lips, Oil, and Sealing**\n\n* *The Body Shop Hemp Heavy-Duty Lip Care* (MRP Rs. 395) : Despite having multiple tubes of this, I couldn't find even one to photograph. I will cry if they discontinue this, ngl. Great under makeup, great by itself. HG, WRP. Lips feel nice and plump in the morning and it keeps liquid lipsticks from drying out my lips.\n* *Disguise Cosmetics Rainbow Glow Oil* (30 ml, MRP Rs.700) : I used to love it, but now I'm ambivalent towards it (mostly because it's hard to finish up before it starts yellowing and losing its efficacy). Super light, sinks in well. I use it with and without moisturiser. Didn't clog pores. Will RP if it is on sale.\n* *Vaseline Original Pure Skin Jelly* (21g, MRP Rs.42) : Why is this fragranced ? Why ? But it is nice, does the sealing well. No clogging of pores. Just nice soft skin in the morning. WRP.",

        "content": "F23 I have oily, acne prone skin.\n\nSaid product that broke me out. Cetaphil Hydrating foaming cream cleanser\n\nI started my new skincare journey a month ago. I've always just used cleanser since it's hard to pin down what works for my skin. So far, the cleanser that worked for me and improved my face was Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (old formula). Then, I switched to CosRX daily gentle cleanser, but I went back again to Cetaphil (bar version). All of them worked for me, but I found CosRX to sting a little around my nose area, so I went back to Cetaphil.\n\nAround last two months, I bought **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser in its huge bottle (900 PHP or so), only to learn it would make me break out so bad.\n\nIn the first two weeks, I used the **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser with Biore UV kids sunscreen + Luxe Organix Cica gel as moisturizer. I thought the sunscreen was the cause of my breakout. I tested another two weeks for cleanser and moisturizer combination, then cut off sunscreen from the routine, only to find fungal acne on my forehead, gradually progressing to pimples on all other places of my face.\n\nI was still hesitant to drop my Cetaphil because I bought a huge bottle and thought it would work as other Cetaphil versions did for me, so I stopped my moisturizer for another week. But lo and behold, the pimples keep popping out every single day, on my cheeks and neck, and they hurt so bad. I thought I had a problem with my teeth nerve roots or something because it kinda feels like gum ache at this point, lol.\n\nAfter staying with a cleanser only for around three days, my face start to look unhealthy, oily, and my pores were much noticeable prolly cos of the lack of moisturiser. My face was nowhere perfect before but it didnt get this bad since i started using cleanser 2 years ago. It doesn't have its usual glow and looks similar to how I look when I don't wash my face with anything when I run out of my cleanser. And the f pimples constellating on my face just hurts so bad!\n\nAfter this one and a half month ish battle, I traveled away from home and I didn't bring my cleanser, so I stayed without it for about three days, and pimples were still relentless in reminding me how I would be looking ugly.\n\nThen, I picked up Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser new formula in its smallest bottle, praying ten times before I took it from the shelf. This cleanser has a creamy translucent texture that feels much more gentle than the foaming one. It only took a matter of two days to make the pimples stop, and my face starts feeling better. I do have so much pimple marks to deal with now tho.\n\n***I included*** [before and after photos.](https://imgur.com/a/I7AkGbW) ***im not sure if you can see much of the difference, but anw, hope that helps.***",

          "Skincare is always a YMMV thing. If there’s one thing I learned, dermatologists end up cheaper than trying cult favorites or online recos. If I took everything I spent, mas mura and mabilis derma + isotretinoin + lasers. And with longer- lasting effects too. \n\nThat said if a product causes irritation. Stop immediately and focus on not irritating your skin and keeping it hydrated to lessen scarring. What works for others won’t necessarily work for you talaga. Cetaphil was not good for me too. Neither was niacinamide. Nor SK II. Iba iba talaga.",

        "title": "Skincare and Grooming tips for Indian Teenage Boys (from a 19 y/o who’s been there)",
        "content": "**Why Skincare Matters (Especially in India)**\n\nIf you think skincare is unimportant, you’re wrong. Every man you idolize online — actors, influencers, athletes — all do some form of skincare (and even makeup sometimes). It’s not “girly” or “sigma” or whatever cringe label people throw around. It’s just hygiene and self-care.\n\nWhy is skincare extra important for Indian guys?\n\t•\tWeather: Sweaty summers, dry winters, crazy humidity — our skin suffers.\n\t•\tPollution: Indian cities = dust, dirt, and pollution constantly clogging your pores.\n\t•\tGenetics: Indian skin is more prone to acne scars, pigmentation, and tanning.\n\t•\tSun Exposure: UV index here is brutal. Skipping sunscreen will make you look like an old leather bag at 30.\n\nTL;DR — Take care of your skin now or regret it later.\n\n\n\n**Skincare Routine for Beginners**\n\n**Before we start**: Identify Your Skin Type & Concern\n\nFirst things first — figure out:\n\t•\tSkin Type: Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal?\n\t•\tMain Concerns: Acne? Dull skin? Pigmentation? Uneven tone?\n\n**Golden Rule:** Always buy products based on your skin type and concerns — not random Instagram trends.\nIf possible, visit a dermatologist once to get a proper analysis.\n\n**Daily Routine**\n\n**Step 1: Cleanser (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tWash face with a gentle cleanser (like CeraVe).\n\tPM Tip: If you use sunscreen (which you should), double cleanse at night —\n\t1.\tFirst, wipe face with micellar water (like Bioderma).\n\t2.\tThen, cleanse with face wash.\n\t•\tOn extra sweaty/dirty days, I swap my PM cleanser with a Salicylic Acid Cleanser (like Minimalist).\n\n**Step 2: Toner (Optional, AM)**\n\t•\tAfter cleansing, pat face dry with a clean face towel.\n\t•\tUse toner only if needed — for dry skin, I use TONYMOLY Ceramide Mochi Toner. Most people can skip this.\n\n**Step 3: Targeted Serums (AM/PM)**\n\nSerums = Targeted treatment for specific concerns. Choose based on your needs:\n\t•\tHydration: Hyaluronic Acid\n\t•\tBrightening: Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Kojic Acid\n\t•\tExfoliation (2x a week): Glycolic Acid\n\t•\tAcne Treatment: Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil\n\nWhat I use:\n\t•\tAM: Vitamin C (daily)\n\t•\tPM: Salicylic Acid (3x/week) & Glycolic Acid (2x/week)\n\n**Step 4: Moisturizer (AM/PM)**\n\t•\tAfter serum, always moisturize.\n\t•\tI use:\n\t•\tCetaphil DAM (for normal to dry skin)\n\t•\tBioderma Atoderm Crème Ultra (heavy-duty)\n\n**Step 5: Sunscreen (AM only — non-negotiable)**\n\t•\tFor dry/normal skin: Cream-based sunscreen\n\t•\tFor oily/combination skin: Gel-based sunscreen\n\t•\tMinimum: SPF 50 + PA+++\n\nI use UV Doux Gel Sunscreen — works well, non-sticky.\nAvoid influencer hype brands. Stick to reliable drugstore options.\n\n\n**Haircare Routine**\n\n\n**Step 1: Shampoo**\n\t•\tFrequency depends on sweat/dirt. Generally, 2x a week works.\n\t•\tUse sulfate & paraben-free shampoo.\n\t•\tPersonally, for my thick, wavy hair, only L’Oréal Professional Range shampoos make my scalp feel truly clean.\n\n**Step 2: Conditioner**\n\t•\tEvery time you shampoo, follow it up with conditioner.\n\n**Step 3: Leave-in Conditioner / Hair Serum**\n\t•\tNot mandatory, but if you have dry hair, it’s a game-changer.\n\n**Step 4: Hair Mask (Optional)**\n\t•\tFor very dry/damaged hair, use a mask once a week.\n\n\n\n**Grooming Essentials**\n\n**Lip Care**\n\t•\tAM: Apply Nivea Original Care lip balm.\n\t•\tPM: Use plain old Vaseline or Boroline before bed.\n\n**Shaving (for clean-shaven guys)**\n\t•\tUse a good razor —  I use the Gillette Fusion 5 Power.\n\t•\tShaving foam? Try Gillette Charcoal Foam (cooling effect is elite).\n\t•\tAfter shave, apply an after shave lotion followed by a moisturizer.\n\n**Beard Care (for my beard bros)**\n\t•\tGet a good quality Philips Trimmer (adjustable heads are clutch for styling).\n\n**Body Grooming**\n\t•\tGet a ceramic blade trimmer for body hair.\n\t•\tAlso, invest in a nose/ear trimmer (trust me — game changer).\n\n**Extra Hygiene Tips**\n\nDeo/Roll-on\n\t•\tMy picks: Nivea Maxx Fresh or Rexona Men or Chemist at Play 5% AHA (for dark pits)\n\nOral Hygiene\n\t•\tFloss before brushing. Brush for 2 mins. Use a tongue cleaner. Follow up with a mouthwash.\n\nSmelling Good\n\t•\tMix a few drops of Plum body oil into your body lotion.\n\t•\tOr invest in a good perfume (r/DesiFragranceAddicts has great recos).\n\n**Final Advice**\n\nSkincare & grooming aren’t “cringe” — they’re basic self-respect.\nTake care of yourself and you’ll naturally feel more confident. Whether you’re trying to impress your crush, glow up for college, or just feel good in your own skin - you may even end up getting the baddie too😉\n\nNeed product recos? You can head over to r/IndianSkincareAddicts .\n\n**I know my personal routine might seem expensive for a lot of teenagers, and trust me, I get it. But I’ve chosen to invest in myself because I see it as a long-term investment in my confidence and appearance. That being said, you absolutely don’t need to spend this much to build a solid routine. There are plenty of budget-friendly products that work just as well, especially if you focus on the basics — cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Skincare doesn’t have to break the bank.**",

It’s a non-foaming creamy gel, very gentle and hydrating. \n\nMy skin is sensitive (Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and LRP Toleriane sting my face; Cetaphil feels drying) but I had no irritation from the Marcelle - my skin just felt clean and comfortable, which is exactly what I want from a cleanser.

I never got to try the old formula so I can't comment on that. ",

          "I really like the Marcelle brand in general. Their micellar water and 2 phase eye make up remover are 2 of my favourite things. The BB cream is lovely and they have a couple of really nice night creams.\n\nThe only thing I've tried that I was ever disappointed in is the new retinol + probiotic serum but I feel like it's the packaging that makes it suck - if it was in an airless pump it would probably be less frustrating. It's just too thick for a dropper",
