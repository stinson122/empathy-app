    "effects": "My skin is already so sensitive and dry, but the Low pH and Salicylic Acid Cleansers doesn't make it worse. The Low ph cleanser does wonders in drying out pimples and cleaning the face without any stripping. Sometimes, kapag nakakalimutan ko mag moisturize, gigising ako kinabukasan w/o any dry, flaky, and redness on any parts of my face. I only use the Salicylic Acid cleanser 2 or 3 times a week. Low lang concentration niya ng Salicylic Acid, pero its really helpful in removing white heads around the nose, chin, and forehead (just make sure to rub it thoroughly).",

The Axis-Y quinoa cleanser has a thinner and more watery consistency than COSRX, so I use this in the PM after cleansing with a balm (I use Heimish‚Äôs btw!). It lathers just enough to get rid of any residual makeup, sunscreen, and/or cleansing balm. And when I get out of the shower at night, my face doesn‚Äôt feel uncomfortably tight. Just a note: Both of these cleansers smell clean (somewhat botanical?) but aren‚Äôt fragranced to high heaven, so they‚Äôre perfect for someone like me who also happens to dislike strong perfume-y scents in skincare.",
