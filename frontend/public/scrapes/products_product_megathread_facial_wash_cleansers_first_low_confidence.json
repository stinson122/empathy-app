The Axis-Y quinoa cleanser has a thinner and more watery consistency than COSRX, so I use this in the PM after cleansing with a balm (I use Heimish‚Äôs btw!). It lathers just enough to get rid of any residual makeup, sunscreen, and/or cleansing balm. And when I get out of the shower at night, my face doesn‚Äôt feel uncomfortably tight.
