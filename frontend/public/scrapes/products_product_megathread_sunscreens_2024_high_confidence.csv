Product Name: ANESSA Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Gel
Price and Size: P1490 in Shopee 90g (I bought this much cheaper in yen)
Effects/Experience: It has been my fave sunscreen so far! There’s no whitecast and it acts as a makeup primer. My skin instantly brigtens up whenever I put this, so I can just use this and wear lipstick if I go somewhere where I don’t need to use full make-up. Bought this last October and have yet to finish it.
I love that there’s no sticky feeling unlike Biore, and I can layer it up when I know I’ll go somewhere with prolonged sun exposure. Also tried applying it over makeup, so long as I tap it unto my skin there’s no trace of reapplication.
I’ve tried the UV milk and I like them both, but the Gel one just sits better on my oily skin imo. I also love that there’s a smaller sized pack, so I just refill the bottle when I’m traveling.
Btw I’m using the old formula.
