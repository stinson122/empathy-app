Product Name: Biore UV Aqua Rich
Price and Size: 800yen for 100mL? not really sure abt the size
Effects: Decided to try this kasi I've seen a lot of good reviews about it. Has a faint chemical (?) scent, stings around the eyes, and leaves a whitecast (which tbf was manageable din naman) but omg just a day after I used it, I got comedones on my forehead! They were so noticeable and I had to get a facial just to get rid of them. I stopped using it after three days kasi the whiteheads were multiplying na. It also leaves a super oily finish which I hate. This was one of the reasons why I decided to consult a dermatologist na.
