        "comment": "F23 I have oily, acne prone skin.\nSaid product that broke me out. Cetaphil Hydrating foaming cream cleanser\nI started my new skincare journey a month ago. I've always just used cleanser since it's hard to pin down what works for my skin. So far, the cleanser that worked for me and improved my face was Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (old formula). Then, I switched to CosRX daily gentle cleanser, but I went back again to Cetaphil (bar version). All of them worked for me, but I found CosRX to sting a little around my nose area, so I went back to Cetaphil.\nAround last two months, I bought **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser in its huge bottle (900 PHP or so), only to learn it would make me break out so bad.\nIn the first two weeks, I used the **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser with Biore UV kids sunscreen + Luxe Organix Cica gel as moisturizer. I thought the sunscreen was the cause of my breakout. I tested another two weeks for cleanser and moisturizer combination, then cut off sunscreen from the routine, only to find fungal acne on my forehead, gradually progressing to pimples on all other places of my face.\nI was still hesitant to drop my Cetaphil because I bought a huge bottle and thought it would work as other Cetaphil versions did for me, so I stopped my moisturizer for another week. But lo and behold, the pimples keep popping out every single day, on my cheeks and neck, and they hurt so bad. I thought I had a problem with my teeth nerve roots or something because it kinda feels like gum ache at this point, lol.\nAfter staying with a cleanser only for around three days, my face start to look unhealthy, oily, and my pores were much noticeable prolly cos of the lack of moisturiser. My face was nowhere perfect before but it didnt get this bad since i started using cleanser 2 years ago. It doesn't have its usual glow and looks similar to how I look when I don't wash my face with anything when I run out of my cleanser. And the f pimples constellating on my face just hurts so bad!\nAfter this one and a half month ish battle, I traveled away from home and I didn't bring my cleanser, so I stayed without it for about three days, and pimples were still relentless in reminding me how I would be looking ugly.\nThen, I picked up Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser new formula in its smallest bottle, praying ten times before I took it from the shelf. This cleanser has a creamy translucent texture that feels much more gentle than the foaming one. It only took a matter of two days to make the pimples stop, and my face starts feeling better. I do have so much pimple marks to deal with now tho.\n***I included*** [before and after photos.](https://imgur.com/a/I7AkGbW) ***im not sure if you can see much of the difference, but anw, hope that helps.***",

If I took everything I spent, mas mura and mabilis derma + isotretinoin + lasers. And with longer- lasting effects too.\nThat said if a product causes irritation. Stop immediately and focus on not irritating your skin and keeping it hydrated to lessen scarring. What works for others won‚Äôt necessarily work for you talaga. Cetaphil was not good for me too. Neither was niacinamide. Nor SK II. Iba iba talaga.",

        "comment": "Let me preface this by saying that it took a lot to get to where I am now. I am sure many people with similar concerns have gone through a comparable journey. Finding the right products can be tiring and overwhelming at times.\nI come bearing good news for myself and hope to share my experience with anyone who might be facing similar struggles.\n**November 2024**\nIt was around this time that my skin kept breaking out and felt overworked. It‚Äôs already January 2025 as I write this, so it‚Äôs a bit hard to describe the feeling exactly‚Äîbut I felt like my skin was being over-cleansed.\n**Previous Routine:**\n**AM**\n* SKIN1004 Tea-Trica BHA Foam Cleanser\n* Great daily exfoliant but dried me out too much.\n* Works well for my mom and daughter.\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Feels like your skin is drinking water‚Äîabsolutely love this one!\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica BS Cream\n* Feels like a skin balm.\n* The hyaluronic acid in this formula didn‚Äôt work well for me. My skin felt stuck between being moisturized and dry, as the HA kept pulling moisture from my skin instead of locking it in.\n* I briefly used it over Aveeno Oat Gel (mentioned below) to give the HA something to draw moisture from. That worked, but feels too heavy on the skin.\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++\n* A great sunscreen, but since it contains HA, I need to layer it over something hydrating without additional HA.\n**PM**\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil\n* Still using this for makeup removal or when I need a deeper cleanse.\n* SKIN1004 Tea-Trica BHA Foam Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica Purifying Toner\n* Still a good toner, but it no longer fits my current routine (it doesn‚Äôt contain HA).\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica BS Cream\nThe SKIN1004 line worked well for me initially. However, after about a year and a half, I noticed my skin‚Äôs needs changed‚Äîlikely due to aging. Here are the products I‚Äôve used since late November and my thoughts on them:\n**Product Reviews & Discoveries**\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for Sensitive Skin\n* Great when my skin feels overworked or over-cleansed.\n* Not so great at getting all the amount of gunk I put on my face (skincare, I don't wear makeup unless there's an occasion).\n* Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion with Avocado Oil\n* This is when I realized that any oil-based moisturizer breaks me out or causes cystic acne.\n* Benzac Benzoyl Peroxide Spot Treatment Gel (5%)\n* Effective spot treatment.\n* I apply a thick layer to the affected area and cover it with tissue to keep the ointment in place and protect the spot from sun exposure when used in the morning. The tissue also helps prevent the product from transferring to your clothes or anything.\n* Benzac Microbiome Equaliser\n* Made my face sting and didn‚Äôt provide enough moisture. I now use it on my underarms to avoid wasting it.\n* LUXE ORGANIX Retinol + Bakuchiol Overnight Glow Gentle Treatment Cream Moisturizer\n* Great as a beginner retinol.\n* Started with applications every 10 days, then moved to every 7 days, and now use it twice a week.\n* I use the sandwich method with pea-sized amounts, gradually increasing the application as my skin tolerated it.\n* Glow Glass Ceramide Moisturizer (Cera Glow Healthy Gel Cream)\n* Previously used this brand and returned to it.\n* Contains niacinamide, ceramides, and no hyaluronic acid‚Äîa good detox moisturizer when I wanted to simplify my routine.\n* Feels nice but isn‚Äôt quite enough for the colder season.\n* Glow Glass AHA BHA Renewing Serum\n* Repurchased as an exfoliant for my current routine.\n* Feels great on initial application‚Äîdidn‚Äôt dry me out.\n* Sometimes causes small breakouts, possibly due to its concentration.\n* Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat Gel Moisturizer\n* Bought hoping it would be more hydrating.\n* Good moisturizer but not quite enough for Philippine cold season, LOL.\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* Combines gentleness and cleansing power perfectly‚Äîmy daily cleanser now.\n* I alternate with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser on sensitive days.\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n* Holy Grail moisturizer!\n* A little goes a long way‚Äîjust a small amount covers my entire face and neck.\n* Provides amazing hydration and has helped repair my skin barrier. Maybe due to using it in tandem with the SKIN1004 Ampoule too.\n* I ordered the lighter version (AtoBarrier 365 Lotion) for warmer months and will update after testing.\n**Current Routine (Finally Balanced!)**\nMy routine alternates between exfoliation, retinol, and moisturizing:\n**AM (Daily)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++\n**PM (Exfoliate)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Glow Glass AHA BHA Renewing Serum\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n**PM (Retinol)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* Glow Glass Ceramide Moisturizer\n* LUXE ORGANIX Retinol + Bakuchiol Overnight Glow Treatment\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n**PM (Moisturize)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\nOnce I‚Äôm confident in this routine, I plan to add Vitamin C after the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule in the mornings.",

Kala ko pa naman same effect lang lahat ng Cetaphil products sakin since ang tagal ko ng user ng foaming saka gentle cleanser.\nBaka bumalik na lang ako sa foaming cleanser, kaya lang kasi di travel friendly kasi tumatapon. Haysss. Pero iniisip ko din baka defective item nakuha ko kasi di naka center ung print sa packaging? What do you guys think? Wala naman sya sign of spillage kasi walang butas saka naka sealed naman ng maayos ung nilalabasan ng product.",

        "comment": "F23 I have oily, acne prone skin.\nSaid product that broke me out. Cetaphil Hydrating foaming cream cleanser\nI started my new skincare journey a month ago. I've always just used cleanser since it's hard to pin down what works for my skin. So far, the cleanser that worked for me and improved my face was Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (old formula). Then, I switched to CosRX daily gentle cleanser, but I went back again to Cetaphil (bar version). All of them worked for me, but I found CosRX to sting a little around my nose area, so I went back to Cetaphil.\nAround last two months, I bought **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser in its huge bottle (900 PHP or so), only to learn it would make me break out so bad.\nIn the first two weeks, I used the **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser with Biore UV kids sunscreen + Luxe Organix Cica gel as moisturizer. I thought the sunscreen was the cause of my breakout. I tested another two weeks for cleanser and moisturizer combination, then cut off sunscreen from the routine, only to find fungal acne on my forehead, gradually progressing to pimples on all other places of my face.\nI was still hesitant to drop my Cetaphil because I bought a huge bottle and thought it would work as other Cetaphil versions did for me, so I stopped my moisturizer for another week. But lo and behold, the pimples keep popping out every single day, on my cheeks and neck, and they hurt so bad. I thought I had a problem with my teeth nerve roots or something because it kinda feels like gum ache at this point, lol.\nAfter staying with a cleanser only for around three days, my face start to look unhealthy, oily, and my pores were much noticeable prolly cos of the lack of moisturiser. My face was nowhere perfect before but it didnt get this bad since i started using cleanser 2 years ago. It doesn't have its usual glow and looks similar to how I look when I don't wash my face with anything when I run out of my cleanser. And the f pimples constellating on my face just hurts so bad!\nAfter this one and a half month ish battle, I traveled away from home and I didn't bring my cleanser, so I stayed without it for about three days, and pimples were still relentless in reminding me how I would be looking ugly.\nThen, I picked up Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser new formula in its smallest bottle, praying ten times before I took it from the shelf. This cleanser has a creamy translucent texture that feels much more gentle than the foaming one. It only took a matter of two days to make the pimples stop, and my face starts feeling better. I do have so much pimple marks to deal with now tho.\n***I included*** [before and after photos.](https://imgur.com/a/I7AkGbW) ***im not sure if you can see much of the difference, but anw, hope that helps.***",

If I took everything I spent, mas mura and mabilis derma + isotretinoin + lasers. And with longer- lasting effects too.\nThat said if a product causes irritation. Stop immediately and focus on not irritating your skin and keeping it hydrated to lessen scarring. What works for others won‚Äôt necessarily work for you talaga. Cetaphil was not good for me too. Neither was niacinamide. Nor SK II. Iba iba talaga.",

Finding the right products can be tiring and overwhelming at times.\nI come bearing good news for myself and hope to share my experience with anyone who might be facing similar struggles.\n**November 2024**\nIt was around this time that my skin kept breaking out and felt overworked. It‚Äôs already January 2025 as I write this, so it‚Äôs a bit hard to describe the feeling exactly‚Äîbut I felt like my skin was being over-cleansed.\n**Previous Routine:**\n**AM**\n* SKIN1004 Tea-Trica BHA Foam Cleanser\n* Great daily exfoliant but dried me out too much.\n* Works well for my mom and daughter.\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Feels like your skin is drinking water‚Äîabsolutely love this one!\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica BS Cream\n* Feels like a skin balm.\n* The hyaluronic acid in this formula didn‚Äôt work well for me. My skin felt stuck between being moisturized and dry, as the HA kept pulling moisture from my skin instead of locking it in.\n* I briefly used it over Aveeno Oat Gel (mentioned below) to give the HA something to draw moisture from. That worked, but feels too heavy on the skin.\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++\n* A great sunscreen, but since it contains HA, I need to layer it over something hydrating without additional HA.\n**PM**\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil\n* Still using this for makeup removal or when I need a deeper cleanse.\n* SKIN1004 Tea-Trica BHA Foam Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica Purifying Toner\n* Still a good toner, but it no longer fits my current routine (it doesn‚Äôt contain HA).\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Tea-Trica BS Cream\nThe SKIN1004 line worked well for me initially. However, after about a year and a half, I noticed my skin‚Äôs needs changed‚Äîlikely due to aging. Here are the products I‚Äôve used since late November and my thoughts on them:\n**Product Reviews & Discoveries**\n* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for Sensitive Skin\n* Great when my skin feels overworked or over-cleansed.\n* Not so great at getting all the amount of gunk I put on my face (skincare, I don't wear makeup unless there's an occasion).\n* Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion with Avocado Oil\n* This is when I realized that any oil-based moisturizer breaks me out or causes cystic acne.\n* Benzac Benzoyl Peroxide Spot Treatment Gel (5%)\n* Effective spot treatment.\n* I apply a thick layer to the affected area and cover it with tissue to keep the ointment in place and protect the spot from sun exposure when used in the morning. The tissue also helps prevent the product from transferring to your clothes or anything.\n* Benzac Microbiome Equaliser\n* Made my face sting and didn‚Äôt provide enough moisture. I now use it on my underarms to avoid wasting it.\n* LUXE ORGANIX Retinol + Bakuchiol Overnight Glow Gentle Treatment Cream Moisturizer\n* Great as a beginner retinol.\n* Started with applications every 10 days, then moved to every 7 days, and now use it twice a week.\n* I use the sandwich method with pea-sized amounts, gradually increasing the application as my skin tolerated it.\n* Glow Glass Ceramide Moisturizer (Cera Glow Healthy Gel Cream)\n* Previously used this brand and returned to it.\n* Contains niacinamide, ceramides, and no hyaluronic acid‚Äîa good detox moisturizer when I wanted to simplify my routine.\n* Feels nice but isn‚Äôt quite enough for the colder season.\n* Glow Glass AHA BHA Renewing Serum\n* Repurchased as an exfoliant for my current routine.\n* Feels great on initial application‚Äîdidn‚Äôt dry me out.\n* Sometimes causes small breakouts, possibly due to its concentration.\n* Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat Gel Moisturizer\n* Bought hoping it would be more hydrating.\n* Good moisturizer but not quite enough for Philippine cold season, LOL.\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* Combines gentleness and cleansing power perfectly‚Äîmy daily cleanser now.\n* I alternate with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser on sensitive days.\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n* Holy Grail moisturizer!\n* A little goes a long way‚Äîjust a small amount covers my entire face and neck.\n* Provides amazing hydration and has helped repair my skin barrier. Maybe due to using it in tandem with the SKIN1004 Ampoule too.\n* I ordered the lighter version (AtoBarrier 365 Lotion) for warmer months and will update after testing.\n**Current Routine (Finally Balanced!)**\nMy routine alternates between exfoliation, retinol, and moisturizing:\n**AM (Daily)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++\n**PM (Exfoliate)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Glow Glass AHA BHA Renewing Serum\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n**PM (Retinol)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* Glow Glass Ceramide Moisturizer\n* LUXE ORGANIX Retinol + Bakuchiol Overnight Glow Treatment\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\n**PM (Moisturize)**\n* Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule\n* Aestura AtoBarrier 365 Cream\nOnce I‚Äôm confident in this routine, I plan to add Vitamin C after the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule in the mornings.",

My derma advised this para hindi tumalon-talon ung pimple and covered ung buong surface. Nung ginawa ko to, it made a huge difference and nag-stop ung breakout ko kasi lalabas sa pisngi then lilipat lang a few mm away. Small amount lang as you would apply moisturizer or any cream.",

Kala ko pa naman same effect lang lahat ng Cetaphil products sakin since ang tagal ko ng user ng foaming saka gentle cleanser.\nBaka bumalik na lang ako sa foaming cleanser, kaya lang kasi di travel friendly kasi tumatapon.

If you want to introduce your skin to bha I'd suggest buying the bha liquid or stridex pads (sa shopee ako nakahanap, acnealternatives.org yung shop).

Just wanna share a practice I follow when buying from a new seller, always check the rest of the products they sell.\nMajor Red Flag: Too good to be true prices. always on sale??\nThey sell fullsize Olaplex products for 500 pesos üíÄ Cerave SA Smoothing Cleanser for 500 üíÄ\nOf course sometimes, items could be sold at a marked down price (damaged/paubos/super promo, near expiry) but a seller won't be able to sustain an extremely low selling price (palugi) for a long period of time. and definitely not for almost all of their products. example yung olaplex nila, 30 usd ang presyo niyan.\nchecked their SA smoothing cleanser, origin daw America e outside US yun binibenta, Renewing SA Cleanser ang US variant. and 14 british pounds ang 8oz nun.\nIsa pa, I maybe wrong on this pero Most western brands do not simply allow reselling or buying in bulk to get it at lower price. (The Ordinary US, Canada, Paula's) Official distributors lang pwede makabili ng super bulk. therefore hindi possible yung low price dahil nakuha ng seller ng wholesale. (Not sure about The Ordinary Korea though - maraming suppliers ng wholesale  ng TO from Korea \"daw\").",

Just wanna share a practice I follow when buying from a new seller, always check the rest of the products they sell.\nMajor Red Flag: Too good to be true prices. always on sale??\nThey sell fullsize Olaplex products for 500 pesos üíÄ Cerave SA Smoothing Cleanser for 500 üíÄ\nOf course sometimes, items could be sold at a marked down price (damaged/paubos/super promo, near expiry) but a seller won't be able to sustain an extremely low selling price (palugi) for a long period of time. and definitely not for almost all of their products. example yung olaplex nila, 30 usd ang presyo niyan.\nchecked their SA smoothing cleanser, origin daw America e outside US yun binibenta, Renewing SA Cleanser ang US variant. and 14 british pounds ang 8oz nun.\nIsa pa, I maybe wrong on this pero Most western brands do not simply allow reselling or buying in bulk to get it at lower price. (The Ordinary US, Canada, Paula's) Official distributors lang pwede makabili ng super bulk. therefore hindi possible yung low price dahil nakuha ng seller ng wholesale. (Not sure about The Ordinary Korea though - maraming suppliers ng wholesale  ng TO from Korea \"daw\").",

        "comment": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin.\nTLDR:\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL.\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed.\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral.\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito.\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list.\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.).\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto.\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits.\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency.\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production.\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat.\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito.\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims.\n* Retinol + Gluta\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n* Lightening\n* Firming\n* Hydrating\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e.\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period.\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients.\nFinal words:\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.",

        "comment": "I don't recommend this product to anyone at all. I have combination skin and this cleanser literally ruined my face. I have bad past with skin care because of using baking soda as an exfoliant when I was a teenager. It made my face's skin barrier weak and almost non existent. Just last June, I started applying virgin coconut oil on my face as a moisturiser, massage oil and oil cleanser. It restored my skin barrier pretty well quickly. But then I got this Luxe Organix Cleanser as a gift this Christmas. I tried it once for my nightly routine and it destroyed the whole progress of my face's skin barrier in an instant. Absolute bonkers. Breakouts started appearing again and my face is as dry as the Sahara again. Please do not make the same mistake as me. From now on I'll be back on just rinsing my face with water.",

        "comment": "Same! To think that I actually have really oily skin at first it was okay for me since it would look like my skin would turn out less oily than before but after a few weeks I noticed I had more pimples than before! So I do agree that is does destroy the skin barrier.\nThis product really made me believe that you can never judge the product by its ingredients list, the formulation matters. The ingredients of this is kinda okay except for the linalool and limonene but they are listed last and this is just a wash of product so I didn‚Äôt really overthink about it. I actually asked luxe organix insta account about the ph of this cleanser and they said it‚Äôs pH 5 so I had high hopes for this product and actually thought it was a good one at first. Pero maganda lang pala sha for me sa umpisa sinaktan na nya ko after sometime hahahahha I actually even commented somewhere in this community that it was an okay cleanser but I am sorry I was wrong. This is actually really bad for me specially that before, I was using a very gentle cleanser that has a ph of 5.5 so switching to this stripping Cica cleanser was really one of my biggest regrets in 2020.",

        "comment": "I've been looking for an affordable cleansing oil that's accessible in the local market, and stumbled across the Luxe Organix First Cleanse Deep Cleansing Oil. It's 349 pesos. I got the brightening variant at Watson's last January. Here's my thoughts about it.\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nIt has a very runny consistency. As in malabnaw siya. Even runnier than the Biore cleansing oil, if I remember correctly. I personally don't mind, but I know some people prefer a thicker formula. It has a mild scent, but nothing too noticeable.\nI applied two pumps of the product to my face. It was able to melt off my base makeup and eyeliner with ease. Took some time and effort with my mascara, though, but it still got the job done.\nTrue to its claim, it's lightweight and non-stripping. Doesn't leave a sticky feel on the face.\nAFTER OVER A WEEK OF USING:\nI noticed bumps appearing on my cheek. I rinse off the product well, and since I double cleanse, I always follow it with a water-based cleanser. I doubt may naiiwang residue. I'm not sure if the bumps are caused by the product itself, hormones, or other unrelated issues.\nI'll continue to use and test the product to confirm.",

        "comment": "Hi guys! Glad that I found this convo. I was searching for the ingredients list kasi, dahil napansin ko lumalim lalo yung acne scars ko and nagworse skin texture ko after a month of using LO cleansing oil. I searched if may exfoliating ingredient ba tong oil cleanser, pero wala naman. Hindi naman ako nagbreakout, pero girl, mas naging visible pitted scars ko at texture. Hydrating naman mga ginagamit kong products like Cetaphil cleanser. Tsaka ito lang talaga bago sa routine ko kaya nagtaka na talaga ako. Now bumalik ako sa biore, and bumalik na sa dati yung skin ko in just 1 week :( Mas plump na, at less visible ang scars.",

But lo and behold after 2 days of using (twice a day ko siya inaapply) my brows and lash line started itching. I started getting small clustered bumps between my brows as well.\nWas able to reverse this and calm my skin by using Skin 1004 foam cleanser, skin 1004 Cleansing oil, Luxe Organix Aloe Vera Soothing gel.\nI know as eczema girlies we have different triggers. I‚Äôm still not even sure what soecifically is mine up til now so every product is a trial and error for me.

        "comment": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin.\nTLDR:\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL.\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed.\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral.\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito.\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list.\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.).\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto.\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits.\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency.\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production.\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat.\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito.\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims.\n* Retinol + Gluta\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n* Lightening\n* Firming\n* Hydrating\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e.\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period.\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients.\nFinal words:\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.",

I have bad past with skin care because of using baking soda as an exfoliant when I was a teenager. It made my face's skin barrier weak and almost non existent. Just last June, I started applying virgin coconut oil on my face as a moisturiser, massage oil and oil cleanser. It restored my skin barrier pretty well quickly. But then I got this Luxe Organix Cleanser as a gift this Christmas. I tried it once for my nightly routine and it destroyed the whole progress of my face's skin barrier in an instant. Absolute bonkers. Breakouts started appearing again and my face is as dry as the Sahara again. Please do not make the same mistake as me. From now on I'll be back on just rinsing my face with water.",

To think that I actually have really oily skin at first it was okay for me since it would look like my skin would turn out less oily than before but after a few weeks I noticed I had more pimples than before! So I do agree that is does destroy the skin barrier.\nThis product really made me believe that you can never judge the product by its ingredients list, the formulation matters. The ingredients of this is kinda okay except for the linalool and limonene but they are listed last and this is just a wash of product so I didn‚Äôt really overthink about it. I actually asked luxe organix insta account about the ph of this cleanser and they said it‚Äôs pH 5 so I had high hopes for this product and actually thought it was a good one at first. Pero maganda lang pala sha for me sa umpisa sinaktan na nya ko after sometime hahahahha I actually even commented somewhere in this community that it was an okay cleanser but I am sorry I was wrong. This is actually really bad for me specially that before, I was using a very gentle cleanser that has a ph of 5.5 so switching to this stripping Cica cleanser was really one of my biggest regrets in 2020.",

I got the brightening variant at Watson's last January. Here's my thoughts about it.\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nIt has a very runny consistency. As in malabnaw siya. Even runnier than the Biore cleansing oil, if I remember correctly. I personally don't mind, but I know some people prefer a thicker formula. It has a mild scent, but nothing too noticeable.\nI applied two pumps of the product to my face. It was able to melt off my base makeup and eyeliner with ease. Took some time and effort with my mascara, though, but it still got the job done.\nTrue to its claim, it's lightweight and non-stripping. Doesn't leave a sticky feel on the face.\nAFTER OVER A WEEK OF USING:\nI noticed bumps appearing on my cheek. I rinse off the product well, and since I double cleanse, I always follow it with a water-based cleanser. I doubt may naiiwang residue. I'm not sure if the bumps are caused by the product itself, hormones, or other unrelated issues.\nI'll continue to use and test the product to confirm.",

I searched if may exfoliating ingredient ba tong oil cleanser, pero wala naman. Hindi naman ako nagbreakout, pero girl, mas naging visible pitted scars ko at texture. Hydrating naman mga ginagamit kong products like Cetaphil cleanser. Tsaka ito lang talaga bago sa routine ko kaya nagtaka na talaga ako.

        "comment": "So I got the COSRX lotion after being told na even oily/combo people need to moisturize, sinunod ko siya sa COSRX low ph good morning gel cleanser na liked\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nVery moisturizing, 2 pumps lang need for face and neck, i think fit for dry skin siya lalo na sa -ber months albeit baka mas madami gagamitin\nGlides very easily din and leaves your skin soft and supple, scent smells like tea tree but the scent fades so okay lang and it left a dewy finish after a while\nAFTER 3 WEEKS OF USAGE:\nI noticed na it made me oilier compared to if I didn't use the moisturizer at all. But it didn't give me pimples or any blackhead or whiteheads. One day I noticed na my pores got larger and dahil moisturizer lang bago sa routine ko so I dropped it, I think lumaki pores ko dahil may dimethicone(silicons) siya. I don't think it's suited for oily skin types and sa mga may large pore issues proceed with caution\n[Edit: commenter said that silicones are actually safe but the moisturizer isn't oil free so the oils might be the reason for bad experiences with this moisturizer]\nBibigay ko nalang sa friend kong dry yung skin kasi kamahal eh, ang sakit sa bulsa kung di man magagamit\nSo it's not for me pero baka may ibang nagustuhan yung moisturizer (please share if nagustuhan nyo po!! :) )",

        "comment": "Hi, I wasn't a fan of the Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion too, but it wasn't because of the dimethicone/silicones in it, it's because it contains fragrance/essential oils such as the ***citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel*** ***oil and melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil.*** It also contains olive oil derivatives like **cetearyl olivate** and **sorbitan olivate** that can be comedogenic, so it's not technically oil-free and fragrance-free which eventually sensitized and clogged my pores.\nI know dimethicone/silicones get a bad reputation and most people are quick to blame them as the culprit for clogging their pores and causing acne, but the truth is that silicones are actually hypoallergenic and has a low-comedogenic rating of 0-1 which isn't irritating to the skin. Lab Muffin Beauty Science actually explains it in her YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzM4pCKXZ5Y) and [blog](https://labmuffin.com/silicone-mythbusting-with-video/) that they are really safe in skincare and cosmetic products.",

I have normal skin type so oil-reducing benefits come in last in my list. I get pimples right before I get my monthly period, that's why I plan on using the Salicylic Acid Cleanser (Heard that it's good for treating whiteheads). Does it cause purging? I haven't introduced any actives/acids in my skincare as I've only had a simple skincare routine in the past. But comparing it to the Cosrx Gentle Cleanser, I guess the Salicylic one might come in more useful whenever I get the dreaded monthly breakout? I might use it (assuming that it both works on my skin) interchangeably (Salicylic a week before I get my monthly period & Good Morning Cleanser after) OR Good Morning Cleanser as daytime use & Salicylic as nighttime use). Also, do those toners balance pH level (assuming I'll use Salicylic Cleanser since it contains a high pH level)?",

The Low pH cleanser is also good for breakouts since it has tea tree, and it‚Äôs also a really good cleanser. I used the Salicylic one first and switched to the Low pH one after I finished the tube. However, i did notice that the Low pH one was drying in the long run. But both cleansers are really good.\nFor the Clarifying Toner, I can‚Äôt say if I really noticed a difference in my skin after using it. If you‚Äôre suffering from breakouts, I recommend the One Step Original Pads, since that one really helped clear my breakouts. But it can depend on your skin too, cause I have a friend who developed a rash and multiple breakouts after using the pads. If you want something that‚Äôs hydrating, I recommend the Mamonde Rose Water or the Soon Jung toner from Etude House. Those are really good toners too.",

It‚Äôs also cheaper compared to the Cosrx ones. I think you should try the Thayers one first, just buy the small bottle for now (P295 for 80ml at Healthy Options and Watsons) and then try it for at least a month, so that you could really see if it works well.

But it didn't give me pimples or any blackhead or whiteheads. One day I noticed na my pores got larger and dahil moisturizer lang bago sa routine ko so I dropped it, I think lumaki pores ko dahil may dimethicone(silicons) siya. I don't think it's suited for oily skin types and sa mga may large pore issues proceed with caution\n[Edit: commenter said that silicones are actually safe but the moisturizer isn't oil free so the oils might be the reason for bad experiences with this moisturizer]\nBibigay ko nalang sa friend kong dry yung skin kasi kamahal eh, ang sakit sa bulsa kung di man magagamit\nSo it's not for me pero baka may ibang nagustuhan yung moisturizer (please share if nagustuhan nyo po!! :) )",

        "comment": "Hi, I wasn't a fan of the Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion too, but it wasn't because of the dimethicone/silicones in it, it's because it contains fragrance/essential oils such as the ***citrus medica limonum (lemon) peel*** ***oil and melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil.*** It also contains olive oil derivatives like **cetearyl olivate** and **sorbitan olivate** that can be comedogenic, so it's not technically oil-free and fragrance-free which eventually sensitized and clogged my pores.\nI know dimethicone/silicones get a bad reputation and most people are quick to blame them as the culprit for clogging their pores and causing acne, but the truth is that silicones are actually hypoallergenic and has a low-comedogenic rating of 0-1 which isn't irritating to the skin.

I have normal skin type so oil-reducing benefits come in last in my list. I get pimples right before I get my monthly period, that's why I plan on using the Salicylic Acid Cleanser (Heard that it's good for treating whiteheads). Does it cause purging? I haven't introduced any actives/acids in my skincare as I've only had a simple skincare routine in the past. But comparing it to the Cosrx Gentle Cleanser, I guess the Salicylic one might come in more useful whenever I get the dreaded monthly breakout? I might use it (assuming that it both works on my skin) interchangeably (Salicylic a week before I get my monthly period & Good Morning Cleanser after) OR Good Morning Cleanser as daytime use & Salicylic as nighttime use). Also, do those toners balance pH level (assuming I'll use Salicylic Cleanser since it contains a high pH level)?",

The Low pH cleanser is also good for breakouts since it has tea tree, and it‚Äôs also a really good cleanser. I used the Salicylic one first and switched to the Low pH one after I finished the tube. However, i did notice that the Low pH one was drying in the long run. But both cleansers are really good.\nFor the Clarifying Toner, I can‚Äôt say if I really noticed a difference in my skin after using it. If you‚Äôre suffering from breakouts, I recommend the One Step Original Pads, since that one really helped clear my breakouts. But it can depend on your skin too, cause I have a friend who developed a rash and multiple breakouts after using the pads. If you want something that‚Äôs hydrating, I recommend the Mamonde Rose Water or the Soon Jung toner from Etude House. Those are really good toners too.",

It‚Äôs also cheaper compared to the Cosrx ones. I think you should try the Thayers one first, just buy the small bottle for now (P295 for 80ml at Healthy Options and Watsons) and then try it for at least a month, so that you could really see if it works well.

        "comment": "Hi everyone!\nI wanted to share my thoughts on the Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel (2024 reformulation). For some background, I have oily skin and use adapalene at night for acne. I‚Äôm diligent about my sunscreen use since 2015, as advised by my dermatologist, and I've tried numerous Western and Asian sunscreens over the years. Here‚Äôs my experience with the latest version of this sunscreen:\nWhat I Liked:\n1. True gel consistency: Just like the old version, this sunscreen has a true gel consistency that dries down with almost no greasy feeling. It dries down to a natural finish (not dewy, not matte).\n2. Does not pill: One of the biggest issues I had with the previous version was that it would pill when I accidentally touch it while it dries. Also, the old formula pills when friction was applied. This new formulation has completely resolved that problem.\n3. Water resistance: As someone with an active lifestyle who sweats a lot, I always use a water resistant sunscreen when doing outdoor activities. When I tried this, I noticed that it stays on my face despite sweating and (lightly) wiping sweat a lot.\n4. Works well under makeup: I‚Äôve tried this under my foundation, and it blends seamlessly. Unlike other water-resistant gel sunscreens like Skin Aqua Super Moisture Barrier UV Gel and Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence, this one didn‚Äôt cause me to oil up throughout the day.\n5. Not drying or stinging: Even though it contains alcohol, it doesn‚Äôt feel drying or sting my skin.\n6. No white cast!\n7. No added fragrance: This has a bit of an alcohol smell but when it dries down, the scent fades.\nCons:\n1. Alcohol Ingredient: This may not be for those who are sensitive to alcohol.\n2. Not readily available in physical stores in the Philippines.",

For me the skin aqua leaned more natural while the Kose was more matte and dry/silky to the touch.\nCan you compare on how easy the sunscreen is to remove at the end of the day compared to the old formula? Like, would a single foaming cleanser be enough or would this require a double cleanse na. Also may I know how both the Skin Aqua Barrier UV Gel compare to the Suncut Perfect Gel? Thanks!",

        "comment": "skin type: oily/dehydrated skin\naround dec 2023-jan 2024, i remembered it being very cold and noticed my skin felt a bit roughly textured with CCs, tight, and congested especially at night despite my skin feeling oily. i figured that it was dehydrated. at the time, i paid no mind to it and continued my skin cycling routine. i was using actives 2-3x a week.\ni also did not have a proper hydrating product to soothe their drying effects. eventually, i ended up having inflamed skin with cystic acne on top of bad hormonal acne. they couldn't even heal properly. so i dropped the actives to focus on hydration and barrier repair. i bought the naturie hatomugi skin conditioner for hydration, picked up the aveeno green moisturizer that broke me out before, and stopped using a cleanser in the morning.\ni dab a little bit of petroleum jelly to heal some stubborn acne and scarring. in the next 4-5 days they either fully flattened or left a little scab. i got that idea when i stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/4hnc2m/acne_rave_of_vaseline_for_cystic_hormonal_acne/) from the ScA sub. though, i immediately wash my face with water the following morning to make sure it doesn't further clog my pores. i dont even bother to use spot treatment creams with actives now.\nwhen i felt that i wasn't getting anymore breakouts, i wanted to deal with acne scarring and PIH/PIE. so i reincorporated the retinol first from once a week to twice a week. i followed that same method with the azelaic acid, salicylic acid cleanser, then the glycolic acid toner.\nhere are the products in my routine now:\nsunscreen: ponds hyaluron or skin aqua super moisture essence (not shown in the picture. it's a new addition to the roster and im loving it so far!)\nactives:\n* skinoren 20% cream\n* good molecules 0.1% retinol\n* +ful glycolic acid 7% toner\n* oxecure salicylic acid 1.5% cleanser\nbasics:\n* physiogel gentle cleanser\n* naturie hatomugi toner\n* aveeno moisturizer (pm)\n* HN hyaluronic acid day gel moisturizer (am)\nAM (every day): water, NH toner, moisturizer, sunscreen\nExfoliation Night (Sat): gentle cleanser, NH toner, glycolic acid, NH toner, moisturizer\nRetinol Night (Sun, Wed): gentle cleanser, NH toner, sandwich method, retinol\nAzelaic Acid Night (Mon, Thu): oxecure cleanser, NH toner, sandwich method, skinoren cream\nrest night without actives (Tue, Fri): gentle cleanser, NH toner, moisturizer\nafter a few months, i noticed that my skin has a healthier glower, from looking like a tomato to seeing my natural skin tone. almost all the pigmented marks have faded. i didnt change my diet (eating the same home cooked meals) nor my sleeping schedule (sleeping at 12-1am). i did change my towels every week or when they start to smell.\nit took a lot of time, money, patience, and consistency and i'm very happy to see how much the state of my skin improved over time!",

I tried everything during that time, derma, new skin care, no skin care at all, and other things that i forgot. Ill share my experiences, including my skin care before and now\nAbout my acne:\nmy acne was hella weird there was a time where i though na yes wala nang tumtubo na pimples and then 5 would show up the next day, It would come and go. 2 weeks i was safe and then 2 weeks A LOT would surface i was going crazy.\nbefore and during my breakouts skincare\nskin1004 cleansing oil\nskin1004 foam cleanser\ncetaphil facial wash (morning)\nskin1004 toner\nskin1004 serum\nluxe organix aloe vera moisturizer\nbelo sunscreen\nI consulted a derma abt my skin and skincare, sabi nya okay lang naman daw lahat ng ginagamit ko, and then he prescribed me oral medicine (he said kasi bacterial acne ko), ointment and soap. After a week, significantly better na skin ko like a big difference kita tlga. I went back because need bumalik uli after a week and they said na oks na daw skin ko so binigyan na lang ako ointment for dark spots. I thought it was okay na but it just got fucking worse (so i never went back huehue)\ni tried naman no skincare at all but it was just not meant for me. My face was oily, but dry at the same time? i dont know how to explain. i tried it for like 5 days, it kinda worked?? but overall this is a good way to start para mag pahinga skin mo from all the products.\nThis time i decided to fix the acne by myself. I tried the sulfur soap but it was not for me i would rate it 7/10. It worked for me on 1-2 weeks, it dried my skin super so i really nedeed a good moisturizer. On the 3rd week mark idk but i stop seeing some effects like new pimple would still appear. Continued using it upto 4th week same thing happened (pimple would come and go) ++ my face was hella dry. So i stopped using it completely.\ni tried searching for answers and thus i found panoxyl benzoyl peroxide 6%. Where you wash your face and leave it for 2 minutes. I think this is the one who truly worked the magic. Now my skincare is on the minimal side. Also my holy grial moisturizer which is skin1004 gel cream I LUV LUV THIS, this doesn‚Äôt feel sticky compared to other moisturizer i tried.\nAlso i started living healthy rin pala where i started running and cutting off some sugar. Dati lang yun but now di na nasunod HAHAHAAH pero di naman na bumalik breakouts ko\nHere is my complete skincare now\nmorning\n-wash face with water\n-ellana serum (azelaic acid for my PIE)\n-skin1004 moisturizer\n-belo dewy sunscreen\nnight\n-micella water (if w/makeup)\n-panoxyl\n-skin10004 moisturzer\nbad breakout happened in january and this is my skin now.

Took me 3-4 years to fix it and went to 3 dermas\nTook 3 different oral medication for acne and it didn‚Äôt work. Nun latest derma ko ang suggestion magpacheck ako for PCOS (regular menstruation ko though). Yun OB ko took my history pero di na ako pina ultrasound and said I may have PCOS pero acne yung main symptoms ko. I‚Äôm also quite hairy and apparently possible sign din yan ng PCOS\nPina inom ako medicine for PCOS within 6 months ok na skin ko. I still get occasional pimples now pero sobrang onti na lang and nawawala sila in a few days. Before kasi halos ilang months andiyan pa rin\nI still have issues with back acne pero that‚Äôs because hindi rin ok skin ko with most soaps and shampoo. So if I wash my hair dapat naka yuko ako. Eh tinamad ako so ayun nag flare up skin ko. Will try to see if panoxyl can help with it. Thank you OP for sharing your experience!",

It is also less irritating but effective.\n-i only use this at night\nMoisturizer: skin1004 tone brightening capsule cream\n-gel like consistency with little capsules\n-no scent\n-affordable\n-lightweight\n-can be used under makeup\n-not oily, can be used in the morning\n-for me it is not enough for night cream use\nNight cream: skin1004 centella probio cica enrich cream\n-consistency is like a thicker version of a snail mucin cream\n-doesnt feel sticky once absorbed by the skin\n-no scent\n- a little goes a long way\n-very moisturizing, gives me plump healthy looking skin in the morning\n- love the spatula that comes with it.\n- helps heal my spots faster\n-i only use at night\n-main content is centella and lactobacillus\nLast year 4th qtr, i was having trouble with my skin because i keep getting break outs and small deep seated bumps on the side of my face which is highly unusual. I switched my skin care to this since late december  but at first i dont see any noticeable effect. I kept using it, until i add the probio moisturizer just this january. Since then i started to notice that the small bumps disappeared, my break outs was lessened, my blemish spots heal significantly faster than before, and my skin looked sooooo much healthier. I knew my routine is working really well because i went to coron this January and my face became a little tan. To my surprise, my face skin tone recovered pretty quickly and is now on its normal tone.\nIm pretty sure the moisturizer played a huge role on my skin‚Äôs improvement, but i also cant deny that the rest of my skin care also helped a lot.",

        "comment": "Hi everyone!\nI wanted to share my thoughts on the Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel (2024 reformulation). For some background, I have oily skin and use adapalene at night for acne. I‚Äôm diligent about my sunscreen use since 2015, as advised by my dermatologist, and I've tried numerous Western and Asian sunscreens over the years. Here‚Äôs my experience with the latest version of this sunscreen:\nWhat I Liked:\n1. True gel consistency: Just like the old version, this sunscreen has a true gel consistency that dries down with almost no greasy feeling. It dries down to a natural finish (not dewy, not matte).\n2. Does not pill: One of the biggest issues I had with the previous version was that it would pill when I accidentally touch it while it dries. Also, the old formula pills when friction was applied. This new formulation has completely resolved that problem.\n3. Water resistance: As someone with an active lifestyle who sweats a lot, I always use a water resistant sunscreen when doing outdoor activities. When I tried this, I noticed that it stays on my face despite sweating and (lightly) wiping sweat a lot.\n4. Works well under makeup: I‚Äôve tried this under my foundation, and it blends seamlessly. Unlike other water-resistant gel sunscreens like Skin Aqua Super Moisture Barrier UV Gel and Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence, this one didn‚Äôt cause me to oil up throughout the day.\n5. Not drying or stinging: Even though it contains alcohol, it doesn‚Äôt feel drying or sting my skin.\n6. No white cast!\n7. No added fragrance: This has a bit of an alcohol smell but when it dries down, the scent fades.\nCons:\n1. Alcohol Ingredient: This may not be for those who are sensitive to alcohol.\n2. Not readily available in physical stores in the Philippines.",

For me the skin aqua leaned more natural while the Kose was more matte and dry/silky to the touch.\nCan you compare on how easy the sunscreen is to remove at the end of the day compared to the old formula? Like, would a single foaming cleanser be enough or would this require a double cleanse na. Also may I know how both the Skin Aqua Barrier UV Gel compare to the Suncut Perfect Gel? Thanks!",

        "comment": "skin type: oily/dehydrated skin\naround dec 2023-jan 2024, i remembered it being very cold and noticed my skin felt a bit roughly textured with CCs, tight, and congested especially at night despite my skin feeling oily. i figured that it was dehydrated. at the time, i paid no mind to it and continued my skin cycling routine. i was using actives 2-3x a week.\ni also did not have a proper hydrating product to soothe their drying effects. eventually, i ended up having inflamed skin with cystic acne on top of bad hormonal acne. they couldn't even heal properly. so i dropped the actives to focus on hydration and barrier repair. i bought the naturie hatomugi skin conditioner for hydration, picked up the aveeno green moisturizer that broke me out before, and stopped using a cleanser in the morning.\ni dab a little bit of petroleum jelly to heal some stubborn acne and scarring. in the next 4-5 days they either fully flattened or left a little scab. i got that idea when i stumbled upon [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/4hnc2m/acne_rave_of_vaseline_for_cystic_hormonal_acne/) from the ScA sub. though, i immediately wash my face with water the following morning to make sure it doesn't further clog my pores. i dont even bother to use spot treatment creams with actives now.\nwhen i felt that i wasn't getting anymore breakouts, i wanted to deal with acne scarring and PIH/PIE. so i reincorporated the retinol first from once a week to twice a week. i followed that same method with the azelaic acid, salicylic acid cleanser, then the glycolic acid toner.\nhere are the products in my routine now:\nsunscreen: ponds hyaluron or skin aqua super moisture essence (not shown in the picture. it's a new addition to the roster and im loving it so far!)\nactives:\n* skinoren 20% cream\n* good molecules 0.1% retinol\n* +ful glycolic acid 7% toner\n* oxecure salicylic acid 1.5% cleanser\nbasics:\n* physiogel gentle cleanser\n* naturie hatomugi toner\n* aveeno moisturizer (pm)\n* HN hyaluronic acid day gel moisturizer (am)\nAM (every day): water, NH toner, moisturizer, sunscreen\nExfoliation Night (Sat): gentle cleanser, NH toner, glycolic acid, NH toner, moisturizer\nRetinol Night (Sun, Wed): gentle cleanser, NH toner, sandwich method, retinol\nAzelaic Acid Night (Mon, Thu): oxecure cleanser, NH toner, sandwich method, skinoren cream\nrest night without actives (Tue, Fri): gentle cleanser, NH toner, moisturizer\nafter a few months, i noticed that my skin has a healthier glower, from looking like a tomato to seeing my natural skin tone. almost all the pigmented marks have faded. i didnt change my diet (eating the same home cooked meals) nor my sleeping schedule (sleeping at 12-1am). i did change my towels every week or when they start to smell.\nit took a lot of time, money, patience, and consistency and i'm very happy to see how much the state of my skin improved over time!",

After a week, significantly better na skin ko like a big difference kita tlga. I went back because need bumalik uli after a week and they said na oks na daw skin ko so binigyan na lang ako ointment for dark spots. I thought it was okay na but it just got fucking worse (so i never went back huehue)\ni tried naman no skincare at all but it was just not meant for me. My face was oily, but dry at the same time? i dont know how to explain. i tried it for like 5 days, it kinda worked?? but overall this is a good way to start para mag pahinga skin mo from all the products.\nThis time i decided to fix the acne by myself. I tried the sulfur soap but it was not for me i would rate it 7/10. It worked for me on 1-2 weeks, it dried my skin super so i really nedeed a good moisturizer. On the 3rd week mark idk but i stop seeing some effects like new pimple would still appear. Continued using it upto 4th week same thing happened (pimple would come and go) ++ my face was hella dry. So i stopped using it completely.\ni tried searching for answers and thus i found panoxyl benzoyl peroxide 6%. Where you wash your face and leave it for 2 minutes.

Took me 3-4 years to fix it and went to 3 dermas\nTook 3 different oral medication for acne and it didn‚Äôt work. Nun latest derma ko ang suggestion magpacheck ako for PCOS (regular menstruation ko though). Yun OB ko took my history pero di na ako pina ultrasound and said I may have PCOS pero acne yung main symptoms ko. I‚Äôm also quite hairy and apparently possible sign din yan ng PCOS\nPina inom ako medicine for PCOS within 6 months ok na skin ko. I still get occasional pimples now pero sobrang onti na lang and nawawala sila in a few days. Before kasi halos ilang months andiyan pa rin\nI still have issues with back acne pero that‚Äôs because hindi rin ok skin ko with most soaps and shampoo. So if I wash my hair dapat naka yuko ako. Eh tinamad ako so ayun nag flare up skin ko. Will try to see if panoxyl can help with it. Thank you OP for sharing your experience!",

I switched my skin care to this since late december  but at first i dont see any noticeable effect. I kept using it, until i add the probio moisturizer just this january. Since then i started to notice that the small bumps disappeared, my break outs was lessened, my blemish spots heal significantly faster than before, and my skin looked sooooo much healthier. I knew my routine is working really well because i went to coron this January and my face became a little tan. To my surprise, my face skin tone recovered pretty quickly and is now on its normal tone.\nIm pretty sure the moisturizer played a huge role on my skin‚Äôs improvement, but i also cant deny that the rest of my skin care also helped a lot.",

Coz it‚Äôs sooooo gewd! ü§åMy combi to oily skin loves Anessa‚Äôs Milk sunscreen.\nNow, I just wanna share this coz I‚Äôve read a couple of comments somewhere here na they really would like to enjoy this sunscreen but for some reason it just doesn‚Äôt work daw with them.\nMy tip is this, if you have combi to oily skin like me? Get their milk one. It is ü™Ñ magic ü™Ñ I promise. Basta make sure na shake the bottle first. I swear ang bilis niya magblend sa skin like less than a minute yata? Goes well with makeup, too. Actually, kahit nga wala kang makeup tapos yan lang gamit mo when outside, hindi siya uncomfy. As in no tacky feeling. You have my word.\nNow the gel one: I feel like would be good na for dry skin. Coz the consistency niya, for me a, is not gel talaga pero more on light na moisturizer. If you have combination to oily skin, sticky siya e. Tacky. Ang tagal magset sa skin, which already is a good indicator for me na hindi siya suitable sa skin type ko. I use the gel type sa bahay lang sayang kasi. üòÖ\nSo there. Just wanna share coz I really do love this sunscreen.",

Coz it‚Äôs sooooo gewd! ü§åMy combi to oily skin loves Anessa‚Äôs Milk sunscreen.\nNow, I just wanna share this coz I‚Äôve read a couple of comments somewhere here na they really would like to enjoy this sunscreen but for some reason it just doesn‚Äôt work daw with them.\nMy tip is this, if you have combi to oily skin like me? Get their milk one. It is ü™Ñ magic ü™Ñ I promise. Basta make sure na shake the bottle first. I swear ang bilis niya magblend sa skin like less than a minute yata? Goes well with makeup, too. Actually, kahit nga wala kang makeup tapos yan lang gamit mo when outside, hindi siya uncomfy. As in no tacky feeling. You have my word.\nNow the gel one: I feel like would be good na for dry skin. Coz the consistency niya, for me a, is not gel talaga pero more on light na moisturizer. If you have combination to oily skin, sticky siya e. Tacky. Ang tagal magset sa skin, which already is a good indicator for me na hindi siya suitable sa skin type ko. I use the gel type sa bahay lang sayang kasi. üòÖ\nSo there.

Alcohol isn't an overall bad product but yes, as a sensitive skin type, I sometimes notice the way it can make my skin itchy for a little bit.\nI will say other ingredients in tandem to the denat. alcohol OR another ingredient/s is the one responsible for my irritation. And it's usually fruit oils or flower oils, which are a bit more known to be sensitizing/irritating, because they were included as it is. Meaning this oil still contains the natural compounds that are irritating to the skin or can be allergens. I think they're also called essential oils. And sometimes they're used for fragrance.\nAnyway, to each their own. It's good to research up ingredients but also to realize not to worry. Some items work for some whilst it won't for others.",

        "comment": "Denat. Alcohol isn't an overall bad product but yes, as a sensitive skin type, I sometimes notice the way it can make my skin itchy for a little bit.\nI will say other ingredients in tandem to the denat. alcohol OR another ingredient/s is the one responsible for my irritation. And it's usually fruit oils or flower oils, which are a bit more known to be sensitizing/irritating, because they were included as it is. Meaning this oil still contains the natural compounds that are irritating to the skin or can be allergens. I think they're also called essential oils. And sometimes they're used for fragrance.\nAnyway, to each their own. It's good to research up ingredients but also to realize not to worry. Some items work for some whilst it won't for others.",

It's just that, just like what one of the ss i included, more than 10% concentration on cosmetics or when listed as the first 5 ingredients, it'll be problematic for one's skin. These Belo products unfortunately failed with that.",
