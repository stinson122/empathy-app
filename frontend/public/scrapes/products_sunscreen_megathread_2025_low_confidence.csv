Dati ang HG ko talag is the Perfected Beauty Salve Pure Mineral tinted sunscreen kaso sobrang mahal na niya ngayon halos hindi na makatarungan ‚Ç±700+/50ml pero if you have the budget I highly recommend this product. What I love about this sunscreen is that Pure mineral sunscreen siya without any whitecast and meron siyang Iron oxide that protects you from visible light and can help you lighten your darkspots. Unfortunately until now wala pa ako nahahanap na pure physical sunscreen na merong iron oxide that won‚Äôt break the bank :("
