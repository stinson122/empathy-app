Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold Sunscreen,0.81,Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel,"Combination, Oily",380-400 for a 110g bottle (shopee),"I've been using this for two weeks now (mostly outdoors) and this has to be one of my favorite sunscreens, yet. I have tanned skin and this leaves absolutely no whitecast on me. Also really easy to re-apply because of how easily it melts into my skin and feels like a light moisturizer. I'm often outdoors and with combination/oily skin, this does leave a bit of a dewy shine. It doesn't look greasy though. I used this on a hike and as someone who sweats a lot, the waterproof rating did seem to hold its ground. It smells strongly of alcohol on first application, but the scent goes away minutes after.

**Effects/Experience:** Water-based so it doesn't feel sticky and leaves a nice-glowy satin finish. Have repurchased it 100x coz it works great on humid places. Bought another one yesterday in Watson's Gateway 1 branch and the pack comes with a free travel size. So sulit.
You can also opt out for a moisturiser and apply this right away as it also acts as a moisturiser

**Effects/Experience:** Water-based too so not as sticky but leaves a shine after applying. If my budget can't fit Biore, I tend to go for this but it runs out quickly as it's only 50 ml and hard to get the remaining products as it's not in a squeezable pack.
When I worked in the office, I typically used this so didn't feel hulas after.

Dati ang HG ko talag is the Perfected Beauty Salve Pure Mineral tinted sunscreen kaso sobrang mahal na niya ngayon halos hindi na makatarungan ₱700+/50ml pero if you have the budget I highly recommend this product. What I love about this sunscreen is that Pure mineral sunscreen siya without any whitecast and meron siyang Iron oxide that protects you from visible light and can help you lighten your darkspots. Unfortunately until now wala pa ako nahahanap na pure physical sunscreen na merong iron oxide that won’t break the bank :("
