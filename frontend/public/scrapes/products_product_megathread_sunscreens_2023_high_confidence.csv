Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen,1.0,Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen,Normal,"I was trying to find this item for a while as it became viral online at some point. I got lucky spotting one in SM’s beauty section and bought it right away. Super lightweight and it absorbs into the skin quickly. Definitely is a dewy finish on me, but you can powder it down if you don’t want the dewy effect. No white cast, and if doesn’t sting your eyes even when you sweat a lot like I do. Reapplies nicely as well, suits our weather perfectly and is a great option for a beach trip sunscreen (Brought this to a 4D3N trip to LU). For its price, it’s one of the best local ones you can try!",,HG (Holy Grail),,j9s46wy,16,1677211059.0,alienbanana0902,"SKIN TYPE: Normal (But sweats quickly)

Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Sunscreen: Rice + Probiotics,0.89,** Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics,"Normal, Oily, Acne Prone",551 peso for 50 mL as of writing at Lazada under kbeautycafe,"** I used Missha sunscreen pink cap for years already but now that I somehow controlled my oil production, I looked for a sunscreen that doesn't have that powdery finish or super matte. And this sunscreen is perfect for that. I've been using it for 3 weeks already and I can say that I would repurchase this forever. It sinks in beautifully into my skin. Very lightweight. It is quite moisturizing and I feel like oily peeps can use this in lieu of their moisturizer. It doesn't pill. Doesn't sting my eyes. There's a little bit of white cast for like a minute or so then disappears.",HG (Holy Grail),,j9rotfd,8,1677203990.0,ivanilla16,"**Skin Type:** Normal to oily (esp in t-zone), acne-prone
