Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen,1.0,Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen,Normal,₱400/ 50ml *[they also sell a 10ml version for ₱100 in their online stores],"I was trying to find this item for a while as it became viral online at some point. I got lucky spotting one in SM’s beauty section and bought it right away. Super lightweight and it absorbs into the skin quickly. Definitely is a dewy finish on me, but you can powder it down if you don’t want the dewy effect. No white cast, and if doesn’t sting your eyes even when you sweat a lot like I do. Reapplies nicely as well, suits our weather perfectly and is a great option for a beach trip sunscreen (Brought this to a 4D3N trip to LU).

Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold,0.88,Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold SPF 50+ PA++++,"Oily, Acne Prone",400\~ PHP / 50g,"This has a pretty strong fragrance. This is the new version which have PA++++ instead of 3 pluses. If I can verify that my face if fine with the fragrance and the sunscreen, then I'll definitely choose this over the Benton and Beauty of Joseon suncreens. This is just like them but lighter, faster to spread and goes completely clear on the skin. I heard that the BOJ may have a slight whitecast on deeper skin tones but this one will probably not have one. This is priced very nicely and is not as shiny or dewy as the above two.",HG,j9oic0n,5,1677158552.0,hlthnwllnss,"Skin Type: Oily, acne-prone that may also be dehydrated. I notice that a lot of products that didn't really suited my skin took awhile to start showing bad effects and these effects were very slow to emerge so medyo pahirapan malaman kung alin ba yung issue sa mga pruoducts na gamit ko.
I'm quite new to sunscreens so these would all be my ""first impressions"" of the products though I've already used most of these multiple times already.
Product Name: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 500-600 PHP / 110g
Effects/Experience: Extremely nice, this one is lightweight and very easy to blend. It disappears on your skin and leaves it with a natural finish, maybe ever so slightly more glowy than before you applied but otherwise almost nothing. The feeling it leaves your skin is quite smooth and also pretty natural. It has alcohol but aside from the smell which disappears completely after a few seconds, I did not really experience any bad effects from this. This is neither moisturizing nor drying. Fragrance free and water resistant.
Status: HG probably, definitely
Product Name: Kose Suncut  UV Perfect Gel SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 500-600 PHP / 100g
Effects/Experience: I would say that this is quite comparable to the Skin Aqua above but they have their differences. This feels a little silicone-y or idk. It's lightweight and zero whitecast but it dries very quickly on your skin that I'm still not done spreading it but it's already setting on my skin, will does cause it to pill a little, especially on my brows. Like the Skin Aqua, this has alcohol though I will say that my face doesn't look ""as good"" at the end of the day after using this compared to the skin aqua so this may be ever so slightly drying. Also I noticed multiple times that this was making my eyes a bit sensitive and feel cool. Fragrance free and water resistant.

Product Name: OMI Menturm VERDIO UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 350-499 PHP / 80g (also in 220g)
Effects/Experience: This, compared to the other Japanese sunscreens is alcohol-free. Also fragrance-free, water resistant. This one seems to be advertised for those with sensitive skin as this also is advertised for kids. This is very milky/gloopy. Using this, you will notice that it doesn't set as quickly as the Skin Aqua but is still easy to spread and is definitely on the dewy, glowy, shiny side of sunscreens. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing will depend on you. This is just like the other Korean sunscreens where if you want something moisturizing, dewy, and have other beneficial ingredients then you may want to try this.
Status: WRP, maybe HG for the type of sunscreen which has no alcohol and feels a little more like skincare and not just for protection.
Product Name: Benton Air Fit UV Defense Sun Cream
Price and Size: 500 PHP / 50ml
Effects/Experience: I bought this together with the Beauty of Joseon and I will say that they are pretty comparable. The Benton has a green tint which doesn't really do anything as it turns watery once you start spreading it. This also have an essential oil which you can definitely smell. Like the Omi Menturm, this is shiny, dewy etc but is not water resistant. This also feels a little thicker on the skin once it dries down and it doesn't really sets or disappear like those really lightweight sunscreens.
Status: MRP, maybe not, not quite sure yet.
Product Name: Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 500-600 PHP / 50ml
Effects/Experience: This is similar to the Benton but without essential oil. I would say that this has a pretty different texture, parang kakaiba yung feel niya once you spread it, but the finish remains the same. I can't really say whether the Benton or the Beauty of Joseon is shinier, but both looks very reflective after applying but they do set into an acceptable finish. Same thoughts to Benton really, if you like one of them then you'll like the other. Also almost forgot to mention, both stings my fingers as I apply them though my face feels fine.
Status: MRP, maybe not, not quite sure yet.
