Tried the Cica version last month and I think Iâ€™ll switch to it permanently hehe. Love the slight green tint as someone who has PIE ðŸ¥²
edit: It also doubles as a primer I believe!
Con would be that itâ€™s not waterproof - not an issue if for daily use lang sa work or school with minimal sun exposure. Also it has a dewy finish I think so medj kita kapag textured ang skin (like mine lol) but I donâ€™t find this much of a problem.

I'm quite new to sunscreens so these would all be my ""first impressions"" of the products though I've already used most of these multiple times already.
Product Name: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 500-600 PHP / 110g
Effects/Experience: Extremely nice, this one is lightweight and very easy to blend. It disappears on your skin and leaves it with a natural finish, maybe ever so slightly more glowy than before you applied but otherwise almost nothing. The feeling it leaves your skin is quite smooth and also pretty natural. It has alcohol but aside from the smell which disappears completely after a few seconds, I did not really experience any bad effects from this. This is neither moisturizing nor drying. Fragrance free and water resistant.
Status: HG probably, definitely
Product Name: Kose Suncut  UV Perfect Gel SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 500-600 PHP / 100g
Effects/Experience: I would say that this is quite comparable to the Skin Aqua above but they have their differences. This feels a little silicone-y or idk. It's lightweight and zero whitecast but it dries very quickly on your skin that I'm still not done spreading it but it's already setting on my skin, will does cause it to pill a little, especially on my brows. Like the Skin Aqua, this has alcohol though I will say that my face doesn't look ""as good"" at the end of the day after using this compared to the skin aqua so this may be ever so slightly drying. Also I noticed multiple times that this was making my eyes a bit sensitive and feel cool. Fragrance free and water resistant.
Status: MRP
Product Name: OMI Menturm VERDIO UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++
Price and Size: 350-499 PHP / 80g (also in 220g)
Effects/Experience: This, compared to the other Japanese sunscreens is alcohol-free. Also fragrance-free, water resistant. This one seems to be advertised for those with sensitive skin as this also is advertised for kids. This is very milky/gloopy. Using this, you will notice that it doesn't set as quickly as the Skin Aqua but is still easy to spread and is definitely on the dewy, glowy, shiny side of sunscreens. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing will depend on you. This is just like the other Korean sunscreens where if you want something moisturizing, dewy, and have other beneficial ingredients then you may want to try this.
Status: WRP, maybe HG for the type of sunscreen which has no alcohol and feels a little more like skincare and not just for protection.
Product Name: Benton Air Fit UV Defense Sun Cream
Price and Size: 500 PHP / 50ml
Effects/Experience: I bought this together with the Beauty of Joseon and I will say that they are pretty comparable. The Benton has a green tint which doesn't really do anything as it turns watery once you start spreading it. This also have an essential oil which you can definitely smell. Like the Omi Menturm, this is shiny, dewy etc but is not water resistant. This also feels a little thicker on the skin once it dries down and it doesn't really sets or disappear like those really lightweight sunscreens.

Had breakouts the first time I used this with Paula's Choice AHA/BHA (basta yung bottle) so I don't recommend using it with toners of the same nature (acidic??)

It's thick but like I said in another comment, I really dig moisturizing sunscreens so it's not an issue for me. It just might feel too much for oiler skin types. It's a nice makeup primer as well because it has that almost gripping finish.
I really wanted to love this but it irritated my skin. It didn't break me out in visible acne, just gave me rougher skin texture and tiny, under-the-skin bumps. I suspect it's the fermented ingredient as this is also what the Cosrx Galactomyces Essence did to my face.
