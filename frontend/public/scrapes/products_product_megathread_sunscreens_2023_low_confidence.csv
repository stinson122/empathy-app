Belo Dewy Essence Sunscreen,0.74,Belo SunExpert Dewy Essence Sunscreen SPF50 PA++++,"Combination, Dry, Oily","50ml, Php430.00","I love this stuff. This is the most lightweight sunscreen I've ever used, though I prefer emollient sunscreens so take this with a grain of salt. For reference, the original SunExpert Face with SPF40 was lightweight for me, and Dewy Essence feels even more comfortable than that. Some people find that pretty heavy. I can layer this and use three fingers' worth of product without a problem, and it doesn't break me out. I don't really find this dewy or shiny. I tend to get oily throughout the day but this doesn't add to my usual amount of oiliness. This and the OG are great makeup primers, too.",HG (Holy Grail),,j9o63mo,12,1677150883.0,,"Skin Type: Combination, dry-leaning with a tendency to get oily in the T-zone

I got the bundle during a payday sale so it was much cheaper but I still think not worth it for me just because I ended up just giving it away. It ruined my makeup after less than 2 hours.

Effects/Experience: For me, this is the best best sunscreen I have ever tried. It feels weightless on the skin. It doesn't ruin your makeup. Commuter-friendly din! Medyo pricey pero I feel like worth it naman kasi I have never tried something I liked as much as this!
