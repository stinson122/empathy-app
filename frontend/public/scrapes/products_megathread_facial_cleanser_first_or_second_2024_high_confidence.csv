Pyunkang Yul Acne Facial Cleanser,1.0,Pyunkang Yul Acne Facial Cleanser,"Combination, Oily, Acne Prone",950 pesos/156 mL,"My mistake buying the 10% right off the bat ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. I borrowed my momâ€™s 10% panoxyl benzoyl p. wash before and now that I moved out i ordered my own and bought the 10% na agad figuring that i can tolerate it naman na. When it arrived, thatâ€™s when i realized na fake pala gamit ng nanay ko and damn this stings so muchhh. I tried applying it every other day the first few weeks and minsan parang spot treatment lang, like ibababad ko one thick layer of wash sa active pimple ko for 1-3 mins bc i felt like the rest of my face couldnâ€™t take the whole product. It works SO FAST. Literal parang kusa na lang nagpupush out yung pus palabas as iâ€™m washing it off. Then I slap a pimple patch pag di pa completely natanggal yung pus. Perfect combination. Now I use it once a day and apply it to the T-zone since dun lang naman ako tinitigyawat at pansin ko ang galing din niya magexfoliate. Even more effective than the two salicylic products i bought from Cosrx and Skintific. So now I donâ€™t use them anymore, just this panoxyl wash na lang. So yeah siguro advice ko na lang na stick to the 4% concentration if mild-mod acne lang naman and it would work just as well. Otherwise, this product is so good, it killed all my active pimples, prevented future breakouts and works as an exfoliator for me din.

Product Name: Pyunkang Yul Acne Facial Cleanser
Order: First
Type: gel
Price/Quantity: 250 pesos/one 120 mL
Effect/experience: I think this is my fave gentle cleanser na pasok sa budget ko. Itâ€™s not stripping and i still feel my natural oils retained after washing with it. Itâ€™s best used lalo na after oil cleansing and right before using tretinoin because safe siya sa barrier ko. I love it lol.

Anyone here who uses this product?
I was scouring the internet and even tried to post here sa sub and ask for its whereabouts cause it seems to be obscure nowadays. looking for alternative recommendations (anti aging properties and same specs as it na gel-type, low pH and has NO sodium lauryl sulfate)
