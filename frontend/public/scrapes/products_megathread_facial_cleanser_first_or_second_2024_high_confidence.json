Controlled my oil, helped with breakouts, gentle and very low % of salicylic so for everyday talaga. This is a very well known product that I assume has been tried by many, but still want to recommend it because itâ€™s that effective. My first korean product and I still love it to this day! Disclaimer: this is more for oily/combi skin. Dry skin is not hiyang with this I think.",

    "effects": "My mistake buying the 10% right off the bat ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. I borrowed my momâ€™s 10% panoxyl benzoyl p. wash before and now that I moved out i ordered my own and bought the 10% na agad figuring that i can tolerate it naman na. When it arrived, thatâ€™s when i realized na fake pala gamit ng nanay ko and damn this stings so muchhh. I tried applying it every other day the first few weeks and minsan parang spot treatment lang, like ibababad ko one thick layer of wash sa active pimple ko for 1-3 mins bc i felt like the rest of my face couldnâ€™t take the whole product. It works SO FAST. Literal parang kusa na lang nagpupush out yung pus palabas as iâ€™m washing it off. Then I slap a pimple patch pag di pa completely natanggal yung pus. Perfect combination. Now I use it once a day and apply it to the T-zone since dun lang naman ako tinitigyawat at pansin ko ang galing din niya magexfoliate. Even more effective than the two salicylic products i bought from Cosrx and Skintific. So now I donâ€™t use them anymore, just this panoxyl wash na lang. So yeah siguro advice ko na lang na stick to the 4% concentration if mild-mod acne lang naman and it would work just as well. Otherwise, this product is so good, it killed all my active pimples, prevented future breakouts and works as an exfoliator for me din. HG MATERIAL ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘",
