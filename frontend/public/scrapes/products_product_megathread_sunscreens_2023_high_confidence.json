Super lightweight and it absorbs into the skin quickly. Definitely is a dewy finish on me, but you can powder it down if you don’t want the dewy effect. No white cast, and if doesn’t sting your eyes even when you sweat a lot like I do. Reapplies nicely as well, suits our weather perfectly and is a great option for a beach trip sunscreen (Brought this to a 4D3N trip to LU). For its price, it’s one of the best local ones you can try!",

And this sunscreen is perfect for that. I've been using it for 3 weeks already and I can say that I would repurchase this forever. It sinks in beautifully into my skin. Very lightweight. It is quite moisturizing and I feel like oily peeps can use this in lieu of their moisturizer. It doesn't pill. Doesn't sting my eyes. There's a little bit of white cast for like a minute or so then disappears.",
