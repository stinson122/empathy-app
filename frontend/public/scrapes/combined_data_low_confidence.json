        "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1e9d1by/kose_suncut_uv_perfect_gel_2024_reformulation/",
        "post_selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI wanted to share my thoughts on the Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel (2024 reformulation). For some background, I have oily skin and use adapalene at night for acne. I‚Äôm diligent about my sunscreen use since 2015, as advised by my dermatologist, and I've tried numerous Western and Asian sunscreens over the years. Here‚Äôs my experience with the latest version of this sunscreen:\n\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\n1. True gel consistency: Just like the old version, this sunscreen has a true gel consistency that dries down with almost no greasy feeling. It dries down to a natural finish (not dewy, not matte).\n   \n2. Does not pill: One of the biggest issues I had with the previous version was that it would pill when I accidentally touch it while it dries. Also, the old formula pills when friction was applied. This new formulation has completely resolved that problem.\n\n3. Water resistance: As someone with an active lifestyle who sweats a lot, I always use a water resistant sunscreen when doing outdoor activities. When I tried this, I noticed that it stays on my face despite sweating and (lightly) wiping sweat a lot.\n\n4. Works well under makeup: I‚Äôve tried this under my foundation, and it blends seamlessly. Unlike other water-resistant gel sunscreens like Skin Aqua Super Moisture Barrier UV Gel and Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence, this one didn‚Äôt cause me to oil up throughout the day.\n\n5. Not drying or stinging: Even though it contains alcohol, it doesn‚Äôt feel drying or sting my skin. \n\n6. No white cast! \n\n7. No added fragrance: This has a bit of an alcohol smell but when it dries down, the scent fades.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. Alcohol Ingredient: This may not be for those who are sensitive to alcohol. \n\n2. Not readily available in physical stores in the Philippines.",

        "comment": "Skin Type: Oily, acne-prone that may also be dehydrated. I notice that a lot of products that didn't really suited my skin took awhile to start showing bad effects and these effects were very slow to emerge so medyo pahirapan malaman kung alin ba yung issue sa mga pruoducts na gamit ko.\nI'm quite new to sunscreens so these would all be my \"first impressions\" of the products though I've already used most of these multiple times already.\nProduct Name: Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold SPF 50+ PA++++\nPrice and Size: 500-600 PHP / 110g\nEffects/Experience: Extremely nice, this one is lightweight and very easy to blend. It disappears on your skin and leaves it with a natural finish, maybe ever so slightly more glowy than before you applied but otherwise almost nothing. The feeling it leaves your skin is quite smooth and also pretty natural. It has alcohol but aside from the smell which disappears completely after a few seconds, I did not really experience any bad effects from this. This is neither moisturizing nor drying. Fragrance free and water resistant.\nStatus: HG probably, definitely\nProduct Name: Kose Suncut  UV Perfect Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\nPrice and Size: 500-600 PHP / 100g\nEffects/Experience: I would say that this is quite comparable to the Skin Aqua above but they have their differences. This feels a little silicone-y or idk. It's lightweight and zero whitecast but it dries very quickly on your skin that I'm still not done spreading it but it's already setting on my skin, will does cause it to pill a little, especially on my brows. Like the Skin Aqua, this has alcohol though I will say that my face doesn't look \"as good\" at the end of the day after using this compared to the skin aqua so this may be ever so slightly drying. Also I noticed multiple times that this was making my eyes a bit sensitive and feel cool. Fragrance free and water resistant.\nStatus: MRP\nProduct Name: OMI Menturm VERDIO UV Moisture Gel SPF 50+ PA++++\nPrice and Size: 350-499 PHP / 80g (also in 220g)\nEffects/Experience: This, compared to the other Japanese sunscreens is alcohol-free. Also fragrance-free, water resistant. This one seems to be advertised for those with sensitive skin as this also is advertised for kids. This is very milky/gloopy. Using this, you will notice that it doesn't set as quickly as the Skin Aqua but is still easy to spread and is definitely on the dewy, glowy, shiny side of sunscreens. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing will depend on you. This is just like the other Korean sunscreens where if you want something moisturizing, dewy, and have other beneficial ingredients then you may want to try this.\nStatus: WRP, maybe HG for the type of sunscreen which has no alcohol and feels a little more like skincare and not just for protection.\nProduct Name: Benton Air Fit UV Defense Sun Cream\nPrice and Size: 500 PHP / 50ml\nEffects/Experience: I bought this together with the Beauty of Joseon and I will say that they are pretty comparable. The Benton has a green tint which doesn't really do anything as it turns watery once you start spreading it. This also have an essential oil which you can definitely smell. Like the Omi Menturm, this is shiny, dewy etc but is not water resistant. This also feels a little thicker on the skin once it dries down and it doesn't really sets or disappear like those really lightweight sunscreens.\nStatus: MRP, maybe not, not quite sure yet.\nProduct Name: Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Rice + Probiotics SPF50+ PA++++\nPrice and Size: 500-600 PHP / 50ml\nEffects/Experience: This is similar to the Benton but without essential oil. I would say that this has a pretty different texture, parang kakaiba yung feel niya once you spread it, but the finish remains the same. I can't really say whether the Benton or the Beauty of Joseon is shinier, but both looks very reflective after applying but they do set into an acceptable finish. Same thoughts to Benton really, if you like one of them then you'll like the other. Also almost forgot to mention, both stings my fingers as I apply them though my face feels fine.\nStatus: MRP, maybe not, not quite sure yet.\nProduct Name: Etude House Sunprise Mild Watery Light SPF50+ PA++++\nPrice and Size: 400\\~ PHP / 50g\nEffects/Experience: This has a pretty strong fragrance. This is the new version which have PA++++ instead of 3 pluses. If I can verify that my face if fine with the fragrance and the sunscreen, then I'll definitely choose this over the Benton and Beauty of Joseon suncreens. This is just like them but lighter, faster to spread and goes completely clear on the skin. I heard that the BOJ may have a slight whitecast on deeper skin tones but this one will probably not have one. This is priced very nicely and is not as shiny or dewy as the above two.\nStatus: MRP",

Also really easy to re-apply because of how easily it melts into my skin and feels like a light moisturizer. I'm often outdoors and with combination/oily skin, this does leave a bit of a dewy shine. It doesn't look greasy though. I used this on a hike and as someone who sweats a lot, the waterproof rating did seem to hold its ground. It smells strongly of alcohol on first application, but the scent goes away minutes after. It didn't sting my eyes even on hot, sweaty days.",

Has a faint chemical (?) scent, stings around the eyes, and leaves a whitecast (which tbf was manageable din naman) but omg just a day after I used it, I got comedones on my forehead! They were so noticeable and I had to get a facial just to get rid of them. I stopped using it after three days kasi the whiteheads were multiplying na. It also leaves a super oily finish which I hate. This was one of the reasons why I decided to consult a dermatologist na.\nStatus: WNR. Nope haha\nName: La Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen\nPrice and Size: 1500php ish for 50mL\nEffects: Light, odorless, leaves a bit of a whitecast but manageable as long as you let it set for a while. This was recommended by my dermatologist after I told her abt the whiteheads I got from Biore's UV Aqua Rich Sunscreen lol. My only issue is that it's not available here in the PH so ang mahal nya!

Have repurchased it 100x coz it works great on humid places. Bought another one yesterday in Watson's Gateway 1 branch and the pack comes with a free travel size. So sulit.\nYou can also opt out for a moisturiser and apply this right away as it also acts as a moisturiser\n**Status: HG!!!**\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Product Name:** Luxe Organix Aqua Daily Sunscreen\n**Price and Size:** 350 for 50ml\n**Effects/Experience:** Water-based too so not as sticky but leaves a shine after applying. If my budget can't fit Biore, I tend to go for this but it runs out quickly as it's only 50 ml and hard to get the remaining products as it's not in a squeezable pack.\nWhen I worked in the office, I typically used this so didn't feel hulas after.\n**Status: WR**\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------\n**Product Name:** Sunplay Menthol\n**Price and Size:** 500?

It reminds me of Cosrx Aloe Soothing Sun Cream, but this feels a little heavier and \"harder\" to spread. It's thick but like I said in another comment, I really dig moisturizing sunscreens so it's not an issue for me. It just might feel too much for oiler skin types. It's a nice makeup primer as well because it has that almost gripping finish.\nI really wanted to love this but it irritated my skin. It didn't break me out in visible acne, just gave me rougher skin texture and tiny, under-the-skin bumps. I suspect it's the fermented ingredient as this is also what the Cosrx Galactomyces Essence did to my face.\nStatus: (HG for Holy Grail, WR for Will Repurchase, WNR for Will Not Repurchase) WNR",

        "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1kcbilb/chemists_review_luxe_organix_retinol_gluta/",
        "post_selftext": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products.",
