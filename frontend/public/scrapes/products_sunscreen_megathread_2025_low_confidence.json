What I love about this sunscreen is that Pure mineral sunscreen siya without any whitecast and meron siyang Iron oxide that protects you from visible light and can help you lighten your darkspots.

If you use azelaic acid, usually physical sunscreen is recommended, but it has white cast. Chemical sunscreens doesn't, but it always stings. So this sunscreen is perfect. It has a runny milky consistency. It's smooth and very easy to blend. It dries down with a satin finish, perfect for a makeup base or on it's own.",
