It doesn't look greasy though. I used this on a hike and as someone who sweats a lot, the waterproof rating did seem to hold its ground.

Have repurchased it 100x coz it works great on humid places. Bought another one yesterday in Watson's Gateway 1 branch and the pack comes with a free travel size.

As much as possible, nag-aapply ako sa harap ng electric fan or kapag malamig ’yung paligid kasi mas maganda ’yung lapat. Naamoy ko talaga ’yung alcohol, which makes sense kasi may alcohol content siya. May mga nagsabi na nati-tear up or may sting sa mata, pero personally hindi ko naman na-experience ’yun. Dahil may alcohol, mabilis din siyang mag-set sa skin kaya dapat i-blend agad after apply. So far, okay naman siya. No breakouts and bumps.
