For reference, the original SunExpert Face with SPF40 was lightweight for me, and Dewy Essence feels even more comfortable than that. Some people find that pretty heavy. I can layer this and use three fingers' worth of product without a problem, and it doesn't break me out. I don't really find this dewy or shiny. I tend to get oily throughout the day but this doesn't add to my usual amount of oiliness. This and the OG are great makeup primers, too.",
