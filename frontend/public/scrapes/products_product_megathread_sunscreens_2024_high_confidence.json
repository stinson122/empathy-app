    "comment": "Skin Type: Oily\nProduct Name: ANESSA Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Gel\nPrice and Size: P1490 in Shopee 90g (I bought this much cheaper in yen)\nEffects/Experience: It has been my fave sunscreen so far! There’s no whitecast and it acts as a makeup primer. My skin instantly brigtens up whenever I put this, so I can just use this and wear lipstick if I go somewhere where I don’t need to use full make-up. Bought this last October and have yet to finish it.\nI love that there’s no sticky feeling unlike Biore, and I can layer it up when I know I’ll go somewhere with prolonged sun exposure. Also tried applying it over makeup, so long as I tap it unto my skin there’s no trace of reapplication.\nI’ve tried the UV milk and I like them both, but the Gel one just sits better on my oily skin imo. I also love that there’s a smaller sized pack, so I just refill the bottle when I’m traveling.\nBtw I’m using the old formula.\nStatus: Fave! It’s in the top with La Roche Posay in terms of formulation, but this one has better and more sustainable packaging so this wins. Yung tip ng LRP got easily damaged in my experience unfortunately.",
