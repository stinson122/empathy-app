    "effects": "I've been using this for two weeks now (mostly outdoors) and this has to be one of my favorite sunscreens, yet. I have tanned skin and this leaves absolutely no whitecast on me. Also really easy to re-apply because of how easily it melts into my skin and feels like a light moisturizer. I'm often outdoors and with combination/oily skin, this does leave a bit of a dewy shine. It doesn't look greasy though. I used this on a hike and as someone who sweats a lot, the waterproof rating did seem to hold its ground. It smells strongly of alcohol on first application, but the scent goes away minutes after. It didn't sting my eyes even on hot, sweaty days.",

No white cast, very smooth finish and super dewy looking. Lays amazing under makeup, there are times where I've skipped moisturizer before makeup and just used this. I prefer this one more over the regular whitening Belo sunscreen, that one is thicker, this one is thinner and truly makes ur skin look naturally dewy\nStatus: HG",
