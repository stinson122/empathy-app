## Export File Format

**All files except for those generated by the wordcloud tool are exported to JSON by default**. Wordcloud files are exported to PNG by default.

`URS` supports exporting to CSV as well, but JSON is the more versatile option.

### Exporting to CSV

You will have to include the `--csv` flag to export to CSV.

You can only export to CSV when using:

- The Subreddit scrapers.
- The word frequencies generator.

These tools are also suitable for CSV format and are optimized to do so if you want to use that format instead.

The `--csv` flag is ignored if it is present while using any of the other scrapers.

## Export Directory Structure

All exported files are saved within the `scrapes` directory and stored in a sub-directory labeled with the date. Many more sub-directories may be created in the date directory. Sub-directories are only created when its respective tool is run. For example, if you only use the Subreddit scraper, only the `subreddits` directory is created.

### PRAW Scrapers

The `subreddits`, `redditors`, or `comments` directories may be created.

### PRAW Livestream Scrapers

The `livestream` directory is created when you run any of the livestream scrapers. Within it, the `subreddits` or `redditors` directories may be created.

### Analytical Tools

The `analytics` directory is created when you run any of the analytical tools. Within it, the `frequencies` or `wordclouds` directories may be created. See the [Analytical Tools](./analytical-tools/general-information.md) section for more information.

### Example Directory Structure

This is the [samples][samples] directory structure generated by [`nomad`][nomad], a modern `tree` alternative I wrote in [Rust][rust].
