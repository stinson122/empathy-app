# Making Pull or Feature Requests

You can suggest new features or changes by going to the [Issues tab][issues] and fill out the Feature Request template. If there is a good reason for a new feature, I will consider adding it.

You are also more than welcome to create a pull request -- adding additional features, improving runtime, or refactoring existing code. If it is approved, I will merge the pull request into the master branch and credit you for contributing to this project.
