# Before Making Pull or Feature Requests

Consider the scope of this project before submitting a pull or feature request. `URS` stands for Universal Reddit Scraper. Two important aspects are listed in its name - _universal_ and _scraper_.

I will not approve feature or pull requests that deviate from its sole purpose. This may include scraping a specific aspect of Reddit or [adding functionality that allows you to post a comment with `URS`][commenting feature request]. Adding either of these requests will no longer allow `URS` to be universal or merely a scraper. However, I am more than happy to approve requests that enhance the current scraping capabilities of `URS`.
