Nivea Derma Skin Clear Deep Pore Cleanser,Nivea Derma Skin Clear Deep Pore Cleanser - Removed my small cheek bumps that seemed like fungal acne,"I have been using this for a month now. I have combination skin and my cheeks particularly have very small bumps that the facialist said were whiteheads. Every time i get a facial, it gets removed. However, it just comes back. After a month of using this, my cheek bumps are gone. 

(I used to use celeteque only)

Definitely try this! ",https://i.redd.it/1qm8c3t603oe1.jpeg,"If you suspect that it's fungal acne, then there's a possibility that you're right. The ingredient responsible for it isn't one of the ingredients it markets, it's the piroctone olamine in the formulation which is an antifungal ingredient (and I assume its intended function is to be a preservative talaga hahaha). This ingredient is also used in some of the anti-dandruff shampoos.

Lauric acid being the 2nd ingredient maybe helps to a certain extent but its antifungal activity isn't well-documented kasi eh, though it's been proven na may antibacterial properties talaga siya.

OP!!!! SANA MASARAP ULAM MO EVERYDAY!!! Almost two weeks ko na tong gamit and 2x na ko nagisotretinoin due to mild -severe acne. Kuminis naman pero after a few months bumalik Yung sa chin ko na maliliit na bumps and blackheads. Nagprescription adapalene ako for months ulit but to no avail. Papabalik na sana ulit Ako for my 3rd try sa isotret kaso nagkasakit ako and I was forced to just accept Yung skin ko muna because I have other chronic Illnesses which needed to be addressed asap. I just saw your post Dito sa reddit and I tried it! Yan lang then micellar ng Nivea din na dati ko nang gamit then vanicream moisturizer. Pansin ko first few days Sabi ko nagstop Yung paggrow ng bumps na bago then until umiimpis na sya. Now, Yung mga acne marks ko nalang prob ko and like bilang na bumps nalang natitira and feeling ko pawala na din. I have an extremely sensitive skin sa face na anything na ilagay ko nagbbreakouts agad ako pero eto hindi. Thank youuuuu OP! ü•∫üòò
Sakto ubos na yung facial wash ko po. Thanks for the reco! ü´∂üèº
I'm also using this, paired with the same Nivea Skin Clear Toner. So far, gusto ko yung effect niya. Hindi makati sa face, gentle lang for me. Not too strong din ang scent.
Nagfo-foam up ba siya? Been looking for a daily cleanser so was thinking of trying this pero di hiyang yung skin ko sa foaming cleansers :(
where to buy?
I like this one too! Bought one from watsons two weeks ago because I liked the packaging and saw it has sea salt and niacinamide, and I am loving it so fad
San ka nakabili OP? I love anything na may salicylic hehe
Drying po ba sya since may SA?
Waaah talaga? I'm using cosrx na may SA pero hindi matanggal yung mga white sa cheeks ko, not sure if closed comedones, whiteheads or idk na
Kalaban ko din fungal acne huhu pag nalinis na after few days meron nanamam ü•≤ will try this!!
Ganito din ata yung ginagamit ko,ok naman sya
Been using this as well! I like how gentle it is..I can say this is the first facial wash that I really liked so far plus it has an ingredient that addresses fungal infection
Magkanoooo
Pwede kaya to sa strawberry skin?
do you use this everyday po?
Is it ok to use daily?
how long do you leave it for opppp
Can I use this with cetaphil cleanser? Thank you!
Hello!  just want to ask po ano ang mas better na cleanser, nivea or belo? baguhan lang po kasi sa ganito huhu.
Ngpupurge ata ako dito. Huhu
Ano pa po yung other products na ginagamit mo with this?
drying sya for me,
Which is better? This or Garnier bright anti-acne 2% vitamin c + salicylic + mineral? u/Brief-Bee-7315
Safe po sa buntis?
Cleanser lang binili ko and tried it for a week muna to see if may improvement. Sabi kasi sa label ‚Äúvisibly clearer skin in 7 days‚Äù and i must say, just a few days in parang nag brighten yung mukha ko and i like how it looks smoother kahit may dark spots pa rin ako
Within 5 days? Wow! Try ko din nga yun scrub at toner. Thank you üòä
Hi! May instructions po ba kung paano gamitin? Also, may other products ka pa po bang ginagamit other than this set? Like, moisturizer, serum, etc.
THANK YOU OMG my heart is full dito sa comment mo! Trial and error talaga tayo sa mga beauty care natin kasi . Happy ako na maganda experience mo! Same sa akin. Hindi na ulit tumubo mga small bumos ko na sabi ay whiteheads. Yun dark spots nalang ang need talaga tanggalin. Baka itry ko yun Kheils na acne spot remover pero ang mahal kasi hahaha
May before and after ka ba! Haha ako kasi di nakapag picture
Hi! Anong moisturizer po gamit mo after (day/night)? Tia
gel type po sya pero mabula. yes nag fofoam up sya
I'm using this too, sa SM grocery/hypermarket ko nabili sakin.
I just saw some being sold at Watson‚Äôs too.
Watsons at sa Metro Supermarket po üòÉ
Hindi ko naman nafefeel yan baka dahil naglalagay ako cream kasi. Baka may iba dito Makakapag comment? Or check mo tiktok may mga reviews dun
Yun ba white body and red cap? Same hindi nag work hahaha
Sameee
Surprisingly works for me!! It's my holy grail! :)
But this nivea one seems promising!
Cosrx is way too gentle, have you tried leave on SA? Like yung 2% bha serum or retinoids?
I used to have super clogged prone skin and can't tolerate BHA, so I tried adapalene, it worked but decided to stop since it made my skin red and sensitive . Then I switched to azelaic acid, 20%.It works slowly nga lang but so far na minimize yong close comedones ko and it helps with acne scarring (not the deep ones though). Nag eeven out na rin yong skin tone sa face ko.
Yes morning and evening po
I use morning and evening po. Dyan nawala ang bumps ko. Follow mo rin ng oil cleanser like Biore or miscellar water ng Nivea to remove impurities
Just lather using hands then softly cleanse your face and crevices , then tanggal na agad. I think maybe you can leave for a minute pero hindi koy ginagawa kasi maanghang ang bubble nya hahah
Nivea po gamit ko sa cleanser
Any updates?
Actually eto lang na wala sya. Add mo rin dapat yun less sugar and less carbs.

Nagkaganitong effect nadin Ako dati with SSA Soap naman pero iba tong si nivea days lang may effect na! As you can see may napop akong bump Nung naghihilamos ako, blackhead din Yan tas nakaangat na then kanina natanggal nalang while washing my face.
I'm using lang din yung Nivea soft moisturizing cream. Gusto ko kasi yung consistency niya, hindi thick, very light lang & quick-absorbing din, maganda rin yung naging effect sa face ko. For 2+ yrs. ko na rin gamit, no plan na sigurong magpalit pa üôÇ
thank you üòä
Thank you üòäü´∂üèª
What‚Äôs your moisturizer when using this cleanser?
Hi, saan niyo po nabili yung azelaic acid?
Hello, i am using GM retinol san part ko ipapasok yung azelaic??
One week ing purge. Umokay naman i think
Thank you!!
Wag belo masyadong strong sa skin! May kilala ako na burn talaga skin nya sa belo.
same here. bought avene, origins skincare na super mahal pa naman :( and just found out that this Nivea Derma Skin Clear lang yung hiyang sa skin ko !
The only downside I noticed for Nivea cleansers lang siguro is that it sometimes stings the eyes kahit di naman nalalagyan mga mata ko.

Naol may husband! Hahahaha happy for you siszt
Korean cosrx moisturizer üß¥

You can use the azelaic in the morning, but be careful with the 15% or 20% it can still cause some purging or can irritate your skin. Try to incorporate it in your routine slowly. Maybe thrice a week muna and do the sandwich method.

Once your skin has adjusted to it, you can actually layer it but I think it's only for resilient skin types. Azelaic and retinoid are actually a good combo. Just don't overdo it, listen to your skin)))
How is it now?
Wow nawala yun redness noh? Amazing! Sa akin wala ako before and after pero nawala yun whiteheads talaga
hi, any update of your skin today? i am buying it and will also update before and after.
Thank you for this!! sana magwork sakin ü•π
Okay na. Mganda nmn skin ko"
Nivea Derma Skin Clear Deep Pore Cleanser,List of fungal-safe products [2022],"‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term ""fungal-safe"". I've shared about this at length in my post [""Fungal-safe"" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not ""fungal-safe""  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of ""fungal-safe"" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of ""fungal-safe"" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è

It's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ

[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è

[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.

These are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.

**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.

IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.

#üê≥ Moisturizers

**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.

‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered ""mostly"" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.

+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)

Shoutout to u/Remarkable-Ant360 for sharing a ton of fungal-safe moisturizers, especially K-beauty ‚ú®Ô∏è

#üíÜüèΩ Oils/Occlusives

+ Luxura Sciences MCT Oil (what I currently use, either mixed in or layered on top of other steps)

Any MCT that specifies ""C8-C10"", ""capric/caprylic triglycerides"" and ""keto"" should be fine. People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. 

The brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è

+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)

+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance

‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered ""mostly"" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.

+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance

+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)

+ Good old plain Vaseline 

+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out üôÉ)

+ Indulgeo Quench ‚Äì 100% Sugarcane Squalane

+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)

+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)

OP have you tried Treeology pentavintin moisturizer?

I have tried to find the full ingredient list of vc15 vitamin C serum from cipla but could not find one. is it FA safe?

I've followed your tips on moisturizing going great so far.
Thankyou so much for creating a such good informative, unbaised content.I have seen so many youtubers recommendations about fungal acne products but mostly they seems to be on expensive side which really make me in confusion side whether to buy or not.For 2-3 days I was browsing the internet about the fungal acne but was not getting any proper recommendations.Then I have seen your post then I thought ahh this will be also less options+expensive but the moment when started  scrolling down I was like seriously damn she is skincare addicted+ researcher in fungal acne.Till now I have not come across any content about any particular issues + recommendations which tells about in that much brief kudos to you.

Some of the fungal acne safe products i have found 

Foundation mousse from essence 

St. Ives Rose and Aleovera body wash 

Herbal essence Grapefruit and mint shampoo

Herbal essence mint and strawberry shampoo 

Herbal essence mint and strawberry conditioner
Great list!!! Thanks so much. Suffering from FA for the past 10yrs. The only thing that works for me was using FA safe products. Selsun shampoo was more effective than ketakonazole for me. This got me going down the rabbit hole and finding more products. 

Anyways, you could add the following leave in conditioners to the list - 
Giovanni direct leave in weightless moisture conditioner. - good for curly hair
Kerastase 8hr magic night serum - must use for all hair types at night.
Thank you for the list OP ‚ù§Ô∏è. Always great to see such detailed posts here. By the way, Purito has sugarcane squalane. It's available on Styledotty.
Is there any moisturizer heavier than Treeology in the list, I want something more moisturizing than it for winters?
Is C8+C10 oil FA safe?

u/UnevenHanded Hi, the Minimalist 10% vitB5 moisturizer isn't FA safe. It's got Glyceryl Stearate and one other ester.  
EDIT: Also, could you recommend me a good moisturiser? I'm using XL Hydra for now which is FA safe but it's not doing too good in winters, my skin feels a bit tight and all. I'm pretty new to all of this too, so I'm not sure which moisturiser would be good for winters.

Hello Mam/Sir,
What‚Äôs your opinion on Malezia Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser?

Thank you!
This is a very well-put list OP, great job making our searches on products easier :D. However I wanted to ask, I've been looking for moisturizers that can be applied on oily scalp and am unable to find befitting products, are the moisturizers listed here for skin, can be used for the scalp as well, causing no side effects to hair, since I'm very sceptical using any new products, hopefully you understand.
This list is nothing short of incredible. I have malassezia and am starting with all new products to try to get it under control. I‚Äôm having trouble finding a moisturizer that would be suitable for mature, dry skin. Any suggestions that would be safe for FA? Thank you.
Hello, what an amazing thread I have accidentally stumbled across and definitely needed!!
Thank you for all this information!!

I have rosacea, very sensitive skin and am currently reacting to everything I was using before. I also have seb derm on my scalp and in my eyebrows and ears üòî

I'm thinking of trying some of the stuff above you've mentioned but do any inparticular come to mind for you that are good for super sensitive skin and everything I've mentioned above?

Also, can you tell me if Dr Bronners Tea Tree (or other) soap is fungal safe? It's what I've been using these past three weeks out of desperation.
I do use this soap for lots of things around the house and body wash, but it's only my face that I'm real sensitive and having these issues. 
I've been washing with this, then moisturising with mct c8+c10 and organic calendula oil.

Can't use my normal skincare from synergie skin atm at all üòû

Also do you know if any of the Innersense or the Giovanni tea tree shampoos and conditioners are safe? I tend to lean towards clean/low toxic products due to MCS.

Thank you for your help!! This is all so new to me and it's a lot to get my head around as you all likely know very well!

Xxx
I know this is 2 years old but do you have any suggestions for a barrier cream for sensitive areas that won‚Äôt feed Malassezia?

Hey, can you suggest where can I buy Purito squalane oil? Checked multiple websites but it‚Äôs not available. Also, can you confirm is earthrhytgm has discontinued its sugarcane derived squalane oil? Also, are you sure if the ordinary squalane is sugarcane derived?
Hey, Bubblefarm sunscreen is also fa safe
there is no such thing called as fungal acne safe ingredients.. this is all BS.. 
Well kudos for the long post.. but its just full of misinformation and fear mongering..

üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
are you me?
üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Always happy to contribute to the space ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Took me a whole bottle of that to figure out
... well shit üôÉ I just ordered it, so I guess we'll see what happens üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Apparently people who are allergic to dust mites in particular sometimes have a reaction to snail mucin. I do have mild allergies, but I've used products containing snail mucin in the past with no issue. That was a few years ago, and I didn't have fungal acne back then. Well. It's been a while since I've tried a new product, worst comes to it, I'll have to give it away üòå And I'd have learned something new about my skin.
Oooh, this one's harder üòÖ I myself have struggled to find any.

But I have a haircare post in my notes app. I'm still figuring out my haircare routine (mostly the styling part, I have wavy hair). Once I do, I'll be sure to post ‚ò∫Ô∏è
You're right, the Ordinary squalane is sugarcane derived! üòÜ And that toner looks very nice. Adding both, thank youuu ‚ù§Ô∏è
... oh, wow ü•π This is great! Thanks so much for sharing. I'll add them to the list.

Which search engine did you use to check them, may ask?
Anastasia Beverly Hills lip primer
Hi! I suffer from the same thing üò≠ do you have any preferred creams or moisturizers for when your skin gets flaking? Please share if you do !
The minimalist lip balm.
Thanks for sharing! I'll add them ‚ò∫Ô∏è I checked out the moisturizer... I'm curious, when you say it didn't suit you, was it too heavy? If you don't mind me asking

The relaxing aloe emulsion isn't fungal-safe, unfortunately...
They can be used on the hair, yes! 

I use Johnson's Baby oil on the ends of my hair before shampooing, and I mix MCT oil into aloe vera gel and use it on my scalp after shampooing ‚ò∫Ô∏è

MCT oil is very lightweight, because it's derived from coconut oil, but it's not actually a proper oil. Great for hair and skin! Sinks in quite fast, and isn't too greasy. Nice if you want to leave it on your hair.

Baby oil is mineral oil. It's around the thickness of sunflower. It doesn't sink into the skin at all, but works great before showering, and to protect and condition hair. It's a bit greasy for leaving in.

Squalane is the most expensive and the most like a luxurious plant oil. It sinks into skin nicely, is around the lightness of jojoba oil, if not a bit lighter. Very silky. For the cost, though, I wouldn't waste it on hair ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Strictly for skin... but I still like MCT for skin better (only in winter), because I do have oily skin.

MCT and baby oil are the two I use in my everyday routine.

Edit: Wouldn't recommend oiling your scalp and leaving on overnight or anything, because occlusion and heat encourage growth of malassezia.
Well, shit. Removed them, thanks üôÉ
On another note, I wanted to ask you about sorbitol. What is it, where to source it from and how do we incorporate it in our routine?
üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
You're welcome üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm flattered üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Glad it's helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I don't know of any other OTC retinoids that are fungal-safe, sorry. They tend to have fatty emulsifiers and stuff. The DermaCo one included, it isn't fungal-safe.  Depending on your goal, another option is to go to a dermatologist and get prescribed a pharmacy retinoid (gel).
... my goodness, you're right! Thabks so much for sharingüòÜ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Is it available anywhere? The one on Nykaa doesn't seem to be the right variant (no SPF).
It is! üòÜ I didn't see it before, maybe it's a new product?
I personally have not, yet
You can go ahead and comment them here, since you've already checked them out! ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'll look over them once before adding to the list, but I use the same search engine - they should be just fine
If you mean an oil/balm cleanser, I don't know of any that are fungal-safe. I personally use a balm cleanser that is not fungal-safe and second cleanse with fungal-safe foaming cleanser. The pink Garnier Micellar water is an option for a fungal-safe first cleanser, but you'll need to use cotton pads. It's fine if your skin can tolerate some friction ü§î

As far as an affordable routine - I'd suggest the Himalaya Neem Face Wash, Treeology72 moisturizer, and the Episoft AC SPF30 for indoors OR the UVDoux sunscreen for outdoors (UVDoux needs double cleansing to remove). I've personally used all of those except the Treeology moisturizer. Hope that helps!
Nope ‚ò∫Ô∏è Literally just found out about it and added it to the list. I've linked reviews to the products I've personally  tried.

I'm sure you'll find plenty of content reviewing it online, though! If you want other ideas on how to moisturize with malassezia-prone skin, I have a [post about my take on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/10cqp2k/moisturizing_tips_for_dry_skin_and_fungal_acneseb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) The Treeology moisturizer could be an option, u/thesoapmaker_ reviewed [it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/rlet4a/treeology_72_moist_moisture_therapy_cream_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Surprisingly, it seems they only mention the two ""key ingredient"" actives on their packaging, so your guess is as good as mine ü§î

So glad that the moisturizing is working out for you! üòÜüôåüèº
>damn she is skincare addicted+ researcher in fungal acne

Guilty as charged! üòÇ So glad you found it helpful. Actually came from loving skincare and having fungal acne myself - it was so frustrating to see products I wanted to try, only to be disappointed because they weren't fungal-safe.

I figured I'd take some of that sting away and make a resource for myself and others, so we get to pick and choose as well! Credit goes to the founder of the SimpleSkincareScience blog, whose list of fungal-safe products was the inspiration to make one of products available in India. And the redditors who let me know about products to add to the list! üôèüèº
Thank you for sharing! I'm not sure about the soy milk extract, but I'll add it to the list ‚ò∫Ô∏è Have you tried it?
It seems to be a hybrid sunscreen, with Tinosorb S and M as well as zinc oxide? Am I looking at the wrong one?
Will it require double cleansing?
They both are! Thanks, I'll add them to the list ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thanks, I'll add it ‚ò∫Ô∏è I can't find an ingredient list with preservatives, but it's fine, those are usually fungal-safe
Thanks so much for sharing!
Where do you buy the Giovanni Leave In from? I don't see it in stock anywhere.
You're welcome, and thank _you_ for that information! üòÜ
AFAIK, there isn't ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My approach would be to layer a hydrating serum underneath and/or an occlusive layer of MCT oil, squalane or Boroline/Vaseline. I personally use Boroline (the night cream version, which is smoother) ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Yes, it is! That's what MCT oil is - capric (C10) and caprylic (C8) triglycerides. C8 has actual antifungal effects, C10 doesn't, but is nice and moisturizing and fungal-safe ‚ò∫Ô∏è Both are often found in moisturizers.

Glad you like! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Oh, no! Alarm, alarm! Thanks for the heads up üòÇ

I recently did a post about [fungal-safe moisturizing tips for winter](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/10cqp2k/moisturizing_tips_for_dry_skin_and_fungal_acneseb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). TLDR, I'd suggest making sure you're well-hydrated and then getting either the Ordinary or Purito squalane to seal everything in. Safe bets!

... XL Hydra is new to me. Straight outta the MCU!

Edit: the Minimalist Vitamin B5 10% Moisturizer does seem to be fungal-safe ü§î Doesn't have any stearates or esters, according to the ingredients [listed on their website](https://beminimalist.co/products/vitamin-b5-10-moisturizer?variant=41476385210529&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAiAoL6eBhA3EiwAXDom5m4CnEqmJATc3c7-cKwpSdlEC3NN-ZGOSnPW2PtDNsW8z-4iu3YRuRoCXXkQAvD_BwE). Maybe your ingredients list is from elsewhere? I'd love a link to the XL Hydra, too, if possible! Always on the lookout for options ‚ò∫Ô∏è The only XL Hydra I can find contains almond oil
Feel free to input the ingredients list into folliculitisscout.com for yourself ‚ò∫Ô∏è That's how I made this list in the first place. 

I don't strictly stick to ""fungal-safe"" products any more, myself - but you're gonna have to make your own choices about that!
MCT oil or C8 oil, mineral oil (Johnson's Baby oil) and sugarcane squalane are the only pure oils I know that are considered ""fungal-safe"". You can input ingredients or ingredient lists into folliculitisscout.com to check hair serums, etc ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I wouldn't personally suggest oiling the scalp at all if you have dandruff, the massaging and heat will likely make it worse. I personally use a (very small amount of a) mix of MCT and baby oil on the ends of my hair right before shampooing, just as a protectant.
I have not used the product, so I cannot say
Glad you found it helpful! I personally use half a coin-sized amount of aloe gel, with a few drops of MCT oil mixed in, as a scalp ""moisturiser"", after I wash my hair. I part my hair and apply it while my hair is still dripping wet, and towel dry after. Barely gets on the towel, since it's just on the scalp. I find it keeps my scalp from becoming dehydrated and overcompensating by producing more oil (just like skin on the face does if we skip moisturising). 

There's also scalp specific serums you can get, but TBH I prefer aloe gel because it's simple, minimal ingredients, and does the job without being too greasy or drying stiffly. Gel moisturisers would work similarly, I suppose ü§î But hair is washed less often, moves around more, and has more texture, so they could end up flaking or peeling... you know, watery hydrating toners would also be a good option! More pricey than aloe gel, but easily applied. The point is not to use anything with film-formers (like heavier gels or gel-creams) or anything too stuffy and oily (like lotions or creams).

Hopefully that gives you somewhere to start!
I'm glad you find it helpful! It was made a long time ago, so the way I think about fungal acne has changed since (as has my skin!). I did a post about [whether ""fungal acne safe products"" make sense on a scientific level](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/3qwnHZgzla) a year ago, and have since been using products that aren't 100% ""fungal-safe"".

Mature, dry skin would almost certainly need more than one product to moisturise effectively. It's about the right ratio of water to oil, or hydration vs occlusion, or plumping vs protecting. Whichever way you wanna think of it ‚ò∫Ô∏è I find if you really want a one and done, a lotion type product is likely to work - Laneige cream skin is an example of one. I believe Fae Beauty also recently released one. 

Otherwise the simplest and most affordable le solution is to use two products, a hydrating one and a moisturiser. I have a [post on moisturising tips for when you have FA/seb derm](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/WTRPbUVB4Q), those may serve you well. Personally, I'm in my 30s and my skin is getting dehydrated pretty fast. I use Dermadew Aloe cream [(review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/G556lxbIqk) with a few drops of glycerin mixed in, because I find that's a good ratio for me. And it's not ""fungal-safe"" but it is paraffin based rather than using plant oils, which I've found my skin likes. A discovery made by using ""fungal-safe"" products, so at the end of the day just somewhat strategic trial and error üòÇ Hope some of this helps!
If Cetaphil is working for you, then I'd suggest you use that and not worry about ""fungal-safe"" etc. ‚ò∫Ô∏è These are all theories,.what works IRL is what matters. 

Since you think it's because of antibiotics, you can simply make sure to eat probiotic food more often for some time, like homemade dahi/curd, and that may help. Besides that, for forehead bumps that have only recently formed, washing your hair regularly and treating plus preventing dandruff usually solves the issue, in my experience. It's most often an extension of oiliness and malassezia overgrowth from the scalp area. I have a [post on how I use anti-dandruff shampoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/E9g4RB97C2) to treat both scalp and skin, in general. You may find this technique useful!
Hi! So most face washes that are actually hydrating tend to be creamy or oil-based. That works well for people with dry skin, but people with oil/dehydrated/sensitive skin sometimes find the residue to break them out.

TBH Indian advertising still keeps showing that a face wash is the solution to everything, but there's no such thing as a ""hydrating"" face wash, just cleansers that don't dry your skin out _too_ much OR cleansers that leave behind some conditioning residue üôÉ If your face wash works well otherwise, I'd say just wet your face nicely and use a smaller quantity, lathering it between your hands thoroughly for it to spread all over.

It's the skincare that you apply afterwards that will hydrate your skin - I have a post on [moisturising tips for seb derm/""fungal acne""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/UlNZNdLjmv) that you may find useful. 

The simplest and cheapest hydrating step, regardless of skin type, is to apply a little aloe vera gel with two-three drops of glycerine mixed in. I suggest glycerin from your local chemist, and WOW aloe vera gel, which is also easily available (also I caution against Patanjali aloe, it's very popular but quite awful, has tons of unnecessary fragrance and alcohol that can irritate the skin).

Using this one hydrating technique after cleansing makes a big difference - even moisturisers that may have felt too heavy before can absorb better this way. You may feel you don't need a moisturiser on top of this in summers, but I generally suggest to use a teeny tiny amount anyway, just to seal in the hydration and give your skin a little added flexibility and protection from wind, pollution etc. 

Hope this helps figure it out! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
IIRC the Ordinary one is a mixture of sugarcane and olive. Those two seem unavailable online, unfortunately, the only one that seems in stock is the Quench sugarcane squalane. Hope that helps
Thanks for sharing! ‚ò∫Ô∏è The brand is new to me... their ingredients list isn't the most complete:

>Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Aloe Barbendesis leaf juice, Glycerin, Trehalose, Methoxydibenzoylmethane Benzophenone-3, Thermus Thermophilis Extract, Cucumber Extract, Melanin, Phospholipids, Papaya Extract,¬† 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Zinc oxide, Pottasium sorbate, Allantoin. Eco-certified preservative and Essential Oil Blend

Like, _which_ preservative and essential oils... but I'll add it to the list with a link to their website. People can take their own call üòå

Have you used it yourself, by chance?
You're welcome to your own opinion and conclusions ‚ò∫Ô∏è

As someone who has malassezia follicutlitis and has had seborrheic dermatitis, I continue to have a tendency for it to flare up, and have dealt with that for a few years. Avoiding products containing plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. keeps my skin healthy and calm. That's all ""fungal-safe"" products are, is products without those ingredients. 

You may find [this article by SimpleSkincareScience](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) to be informative, as it explains why these particular ingredients can lead to a worsening of malassezia-related conditions.

At around the 13 minute mark, [this dermatologist](https://youtu.be/1nYyrR5OHhk) mentions avoiding products that have plant oils in them. Dr Dray herself mentions avoiding plant oils and unsaturated fatty acids in [this video](https://youtu.be/bhVESPApM-0) at around the 2:45 mark. My own dermatologist encouraged me to keep using products that work for me, rather than requiring regular oral or topical antifungal medication for an indefinite amount of time. 

Dermatologists, just like other human beings, often differ in their assessment and opinion on various conditions. I'll definitely add to the disclaimer on this post, that people should refer to a dermatologist if they're suffering from anything malassezia related ü§î Thank you for sharing!
Having dandruff doesn't necessarily mean you have fungal issues on your face ü§î If you're using regular skincare with no issues (not fungal-safe), then there's no reason to assume fermented ingredients won't suit you.

Fact is, you'll only know once you try. Same goes for any ingredient you're trying for the first time.
I'll do a full review soon, but long story short, it's nothing special ‚ò∫Ô∏è I reviewed the Rejusure 2% BHA face wash, and I preferred that. It was _slightly_ soothing, while the Deconstruct one wasn't. It did not make my skin better or worse, it just did what it's supposed to - can't expect a face wash to do more, TBH.
I'm sorry they didn't work for you ‚òπÔ∏è Sometimes just irritation can be enough to cause a flare up. There aren't any particular ingredients in those two serums that would feed malassezia, however... I should add that to the post, just to be clear ü§î Thank you for sharing!

These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. They may cause irritation or some type of reaction. They may not suit your skin. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. are absent in these products.

They will not treat or otherwise improve malassezia, they're intended for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.
Nope, haven't tried it yet ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Edit: I think all silicone sunscreens are super similar - I've seen people on the sub differentiate between the Re'equil and UVDoux ones, but those two are pretty similar to me. Mayyybe the Re'equil is more spreadable, which makes it lighter... but yeah. Very similar.
Yes caused me bumps
Is it? ü§î No idea. I've been updating it with Re'equil products, maybe the edits are messing with the automod or something
~~... looks good, actually! üò± Thanks for sharing! I'll add it to the list üòÜ~~

Folliculitisscout.com flags light liquid paraffin and says

>Obvious growth of M. furfur was noted in the presence of white petrolatum, purified white petrolatum, hydrophilic ointment and heparinoid in hydrophilic ointment. Malassezia can metabolize the C15-24 chain length hydrocarbons in paraffinum liquidum (Mineral Oil), albeit slowly.

But the simpleskincarescience.com blog suggests that it's fine [if used sparingly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/). It's just one study that MAY indicate it's not safe, and the risk is more that that occlusion will encourage heat, oiliness and stuffiness that will encourage the growth of malassezia.

~~This moisturizer seems like a great option for winter! üôèüèº~~

Edit: I take it back, contains Pramoxine Hydrochloride, which is an anti-itch medication. This is a medicated product, not a good idea to use without prescription and derm supervision
Seems to be! üòÜ Thanks for sharing, definitely trying it when I finish up my moisturizer
The Moiz cleanser seems to have been either repackaged or reformulated (or both). [This one](https://www.amazon.in/Moiz-Cleansing-Lotion-200-ml/dp/B09LL9PD8Y/ref=m_rtpb_hssp_sccl_1/257-2425025-5353750?pd_rd_w=aAPpe&content-id=amzn1.sym.dbb7a6c8-2110-43eb-a38d-6553e877c8e7&pf_rd_p=dbb7a6c8-2110-43eb-a38d-6553e877c8e7&pf_rd_r=FSE32JPJVE48WKJ12363&pd_rd_wg=qMrXk&pd_rd_r=9d6557b9-9885-4431-8eae-d2a052b79a41&pd_rd_i=B09LL9PD8Y&psc=1) is what I was referencing, which has an ingredient list available online. 

I update the post whenever I find fungal-safe products, so yes, it's the only non-foaming gentle cleanser I know of ‚ò∫Ô∏è Some of the foaming cleansers, like the Simple one, are pretty gentle still.

Edit: unfortunately, the ""new improved"" Moiz cleanser ([ingredients here](https://www.clinikally.com/products/moiz-cleaning-lotion)) is not fungal-safe
Nope ‚ò∫Ô∏è Contains polysorbate 20, unfortunately
It is! Thanks for sharing, I'll add it to the list ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Why? I don't use insta üôÉ
I've used the Purenso liquid sorbitol before, and am currently using... Seyal Naturals glycerin? Just some random Amazon brand. Any brand of glycerine will do, the easiest is to get it from your closest Chemist ‚ò∫Ô∏è
That's actually a good question! ü§î I think the ones that are more like conditioners, which claim to be either gentle or ""moisturizing"", those can leave a residue of plant oils or butters (that's the intended result). Cantu type curly co-wash type shampoos. 

I think those could _worsen_ fungal acne if the hair touches your face a lot, especially in summer. Same goes for conditioner or leave-ins... but a regular sulphate type shampoo which washes off completely is unlikely to cause issues, even if it has a few fatty acids. The surfactants will likely just get those off. 

.... You did mean on your face, right?
Unfortunately, it's not, it's contains shea butter (Butyrospermum Parkii). If you're using it without any issues, then great! It suits you, and that's all that matters ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I don't know of any, sorry. You can check out the [SimpleSkincareScience list of products](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/#Blush), they have a blush section.

Most blushes contain stearates for slip and blendability, and those aren't fungal-safe. But I personally use powder blushes with no issues, I think it's dewy or cream makeup that is more problematic. Also, I use a silicone-based sunscreen underneath makeup, so that forms a little barrier, which may help ü§î
Ultimately, you gotta try using a powder blush and seeing how your skin reacts. There's no other way üòÖ 

I don't think it's should be much of an issue of you have fungal acne, I'd only be concerned if your skin is raw and feels sensitive in any way. In which case wearing makeup isn't a good idea because even putting it on and taking it off can be irritating.
I can only speak for the ones I've personally tried, so those would be the Dr. Sheth's aloe and panthenol ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) and the One Thing Centella Soothing Cream (costs more but is double the quantity of the Dr. Sheth one). [My review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). 

I've been using the Body Cupid aloe gel with MCT oil mixed in for a few years now, as a moisturizer I can always fall back on. The aloe gel I find to be the one that's most soothing for me, and I can increase or decrease the amount of MCT I mix depending on the weather and how dry it is ‚ò∫Ô∏è That's why I don't have many suggestions. You could also do the same with any aloe gel that works for you and any sugarcane squalane from the list above, like the Earth Rhythm one. MCT tends to be available in larger bottles. This is probably the most affordable option in the long run, although the squalane and MCT are a bigger initial expense.

All these options should be fine for rosacea and sensitive skin. Maybe the Dr. Sheth's one would be the most effective at managing your concerns because it has a small amount of niacinamide, xylitol and urea, which support barrier function.

You could also check out reviews for other ones like the [Treeology72 moisturizer](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/rlet4a/treeology_72_moist_moisture_therapy_cream_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if you want more options.
... By baking powder do you mean literal baking powder? Questions like this are usually supposed to be asked in the [Weekly question thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/12verjz/weekly_routine_help_thread_have_a_question_ask/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but that part kind of alarmed me ü§î

Edit: oh, okay I saw your post history. Phew üòÇ What do you wanna know? Is it relevant to fungal acne in any way? You can post the same image in the weekly thread and people will give you their opinions. I'd suggest not to use a dermaroller if you have ANY acne or redness, they can make matters worse. Especially since they're hard to sterilize properly at home
AFAIK liquid paraffin is another name for mineral oil, and mineral oil is considered ""mostly"" safe ü§î Are there any sources you'd like to share about liquid paraffin?

Edit: I've edited to add a caution stating the same
I have no experience at all using BPO face wash, so I don't have any suggestions there. TBH, with your rosacea  and how you describe the fungal acne - you're better off going to a derm. 

Grainy bumpy texture can be from many things, including just dehydration, but I think you need a proper plan of action from a derm - first treating your fungal acne, then seeing what exfoliants you can tolerate. They'll be able to guide you if using an antifungal/antidandruff shampoo is fine for you, and prescribe actives that won't aggravate your rosacea. This is a situation where I would say you could cause more harm than good taking advice on the internet üòÖ 

I know it can all get very frustrating, but certain things are too risky for amateurs to do trial and error. You don't wanna end up with aggravated rosacea that can only be treated using lasers. Take care of your precious skin ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you! Unfortunately the latest reformulation [isn't fungal-safe](https://www.klairscosmetics.com/product/supple-preparation-unscented-toner/), as one of y'all let me know ü•≤ Had to take it off the list.
The SimpleSkincareScience page of fungal-safe products has a [makeup section](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/#Makeup) that lists some international products. Some of them are available in India, like the Maybelline Superstay foundation, NYX Can't Stop Won't Stop foundation, Essence Soft Touch mousse. You could get one of those and mix a little with your moisturizer to use as BB cream.

Compacts are tricky, usually it's mineral ones that don't contain stearates.  The ones I know of that are available are the Innisfree no sebum powder, L.A. Girl HD PRO Setting Powder, Makeup Revolution Luxury Banana Powder¬†and Maybelline Fit Me (the loose one).

No idea about actual BB creams ‚ò∫Ô∏è I don't personally use any base products. I do use a concealer sometimes, but that's not fungal-safe. Haven't had any issues with it, probably because I use very little on very limited areas. I use a Nykaa compact, and that's not fungal-safe either, but I've never had issues with it. Powder products have been okay for me in general, I just avoid ones with actual plant oils in the ingredient list.
I haven't been using it for for long, and haven't since the rains started - here's my first impressions.

The texture is creamy and pretty thick. It's not oily or rich, instead it's very slightly pasty, probably because of the zinc. It spreads smoothly and easily, and doesn't leave a white cast (I'm around NC40 in MAC, deeper side of medium). Didn't take long to sink in, and leaves a matte finish without feeling or looking powdery. 

After application, it does give a slight feeling of a coating on the skin. When it was hotter, I felt a little bit of that moustache sweating thing üòÇ But surprisingly it didn't sweat off in white rivulets or anything, it looked fine. It also kept a really nice slightly mattified finish all day - I usually get pretty oily otherwise. That's an unexpected benefit I enjoyed, I could skip powder if wearing makeup.

Haven't tried washing it off with only one face wash yet (have only double cleansed it), and haven't tried it in monsoon yet. I'm not sure I'd repurchase the SPF30 but if the SPF50 is similar, I think that it would be a nice outdoor option.

Generally, people with oily skin who want to use the newer filters can give it a shot. It does have nano zinc, which has similar bloodstream absorption issues as the old filters, though üôÉ Dehydrated skin would need at least one hydrating product underneath, and dry skin will definitely need a moisturizer.

Hope that helps! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
You can check out my [latest skincare routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/13gme9n/my_current_fungalsafe_2023_summer_skincare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1) for reference.

Probably the most common misunderstanding people start out with in skincare is that one product will ""fix"" their concern. And it may - but it goes a lot faster is you have an all-round good routine. I would suggest the Minimalist beginner peel as the ""one product"" (can be used twice a week at night). But if you spend time outdoors, you WILL have to use a sunscreen in your morning routine to see maximum benefits. Even sunscreen use alone will help dark marks fade much faster ‚ò∫Ô∏è
That's... a clever idea ü§î I'm not sure.

Co-washing works because conditioners usually contain multiple emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers (stuff that boosts the process). The Ordinary one just contains cetearyl alcohol, which doesn't emulsify by itself, AFAIK. It's a thickener, stabilizer, co-emulsifier, but not used as a standalone emulsifying agent... I'd guess you'd get a very, very gentle cleanse, if at all. Certain not sufficient if you have an oily scalp. Co-washing in general is pretty awful for oily scalps, it's notorious for causing dandruff üòÖ

And cetearyl alcohol itself may aggravate malassezia related issues. Since doing this post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol does have some [research showing it feeds malassezia](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#Fatty_Alcohols). Some people seem to be able to use it with no issue, but it's a trial and error thing. 

May I ask why you're considering co-washing?
Thanks! It also looks to have piroctone olamine, which is nice. Might get this for myself if I dye my hair and can't use Head & Shoulders anymore ü§î 

I can't seem to edit this post on mobile, but I'll add it to the list when I get to my laptop.
It can cause flare-ups if it's hot and humid, for sure. Especially if you're being active or exercising.

Best to only do if you feel very dry, or have barrier damage - in which case healing your broken barrier is your priority. A thin layer may be fine at nighttime and/or if you're in an AC environment. The tiniest amount can be enough. 

I personally don't use Vaseline because it's just too slippy. Much prefer Boroline.
The vast majority of masks and treatments contain plant oils. I personally use [this technique](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/gRfgTvDjg9). 

You should be fine using wash-off conditioners, as long as you avoid the scalp. I use aloe gel mixed with MCT as a leave-in, details are in the link.
Hi there! Tretinoin is Schedule H drug in India and must be used with doctor's prescription only.

I don't personally stick to a ""fungal-safe"" routine any more. My skin is now combination type in winter. I'm using Dermadew cream as a moisturizer, it works well. It's not super heavy, and it's paraffin-based. Has a mild fragrance.

Goes on like a light cream, has a ""waterbomb"" type effect where it liquefies on contact (has 10% aloe vera) and then dries down quite fast, leaving a coating. Not a super shiny one, but a non-sticky, natural sheen, which is why I personally like paraffin-based products. Hydrating and moisturizing enough by itself, for me. May or may not work for you, at the end of the day you'll have to try it to know ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Tracking which product don't work for you, is super helpful to know what ingredients don't suit your skin. I'd suggest you keep a list somewhere, they may have things in common, or help you figure out exactly what texture works best.

You could also continue to use the Treeology72 moisturizer and layer or mix something like squalane oil into it.

Do be cautious. Even with oily skin, daily tret use at that strength, without enough moisturising... I don't know about CCs, but barrier damage is very likely ü§î Bumpy skin can be different things. But you know your skin best.
Like I've mentioned in my disclaimer, the science behind this is speculative at best. Your guess is as good as mine ‚ò∫Ô∏è Ultimately there's only so much we can predict, the only way to know whether something works for you is to try it and observe.

Thank you for this comprehensive list ü•≤ I‚Äôm a noob to fighting Seb Derm and I‚Äôve spent the last 3 nights cross checking ingredients on Sezia. What a saviour you are! 

Wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Which MCT oil do you use and would you recommend using it on the face? Also, does it being coconut oil derived make it not safe for malassezia in anyway? 

Oh and good luck with your fungal acne journey :)
Hi, do you know whether the Episoft sunscreen is photostable? I see people saying that it's not so I want to just confirm.
Hi, Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ is still safe!
Excuse me for the confusion.
Sorbitol is a humectant, a compound that attracts water, just like glycerin. Here's the [Paula's Chouce page on it](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-sorbitol.html). The whole ""prebiotic"" part is still speculative, but I did find it useful and pleasant to use.

I bought the Purenso liquid sorbitol off Amazon ‚ò∫Ô∏è 100ml lasted forever. I'd mix some with distilled water in a tiny spray bottle to use as a hydrating toner. It's lighter than glycerin, and slightly soothing. I didn't use preservative, just kept it in the fridge and make new batched frequently. Never had issues myself, but mimic at your own risk!

Also I'd use it in DIY face packs a lot. I haven't repurchase, because I have some xylitol granules to use up, and that's almost exactly the same... but I wish I'd just gotten liquid, because granules are so much more finicky to use üòë

Hope that helps! Definitely not a ""must-have"" or anything... I think most stuff is replaceable ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Even glycerin works just as well
Thanks so much for letting me know ü´∂üèº
Did moiz cleansing lotion break you out? Did Cetyl alcohol?
It's available on flipkart

Edit: It's also available on beautybaskets.in
You had mentioned lacto calamine hyaluronic acid serum and salicylic acid serum in the list and not niacinamide, so I thought it might be having some triggering ingredientüôà
[deleted]
Between Himalaya neem face wash and the above mentioned clean and clear natural bright face wash which one's the better according to you? Also can you suggest some more cleansers in this price range and suggest which one will be the best for oily fungal acne prone sensitive skin?

I've also checked the review of treelogy moisturizer but still can't convince myself because there are not so many reviews about it so I'm a little bit confused if it'll suit my sensitive skin. So can you please suggest me moisturizer in the affordable side which you have tried?

Besides I've got severe sun tan in the past few years because I didn't use any sun screen back then and now my face is much darker than my body and hand. No idea what to do because every product that I want to try is very expensive. Maybe I need Vitamin C in my skincare but don't know which one should be the best in this price range. Please suggest me about this as well. 
Since I'm a beginner in skin care I've literally no idea about this things so sorry for bothering that much. Thanks in advance.
Sounds great! Thank you üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è

body cupid is wow skin brand right? i seen a lot of hate towards wow brand here. what's ur take on the brand products?
On amazon, a person asked for the ingredients and Minimalist replied with a list that had esters in it. And I just checked XL hydra and it does have almond oil, so there's that. For some reason it didn't cause/aggravate FA for me.   
The ordinary didn't specify if their squalane is olive or sugarcane derived?   
Also, I love you writing style.

Can I dm please? ü§û
Okay, I'll give aloe vera and MCT oil a try, I just need a moisturizer after using medicated shampoos like Selsun or 8x and have found that products having actives like niacinamide, panthenol and aloe vera might be helpful, so thanks for that.

Found one scalp-specific serum actually by Minimalist: [https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CFDYXSHV/?coliid=I34DKO0LACFE2Y&colid=PZ2JDOJ3QCLO&psc=1&ref\_=list\_c\_wl\_lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CFDYXSHV/?coliid=I34DKO0LACFE2Y&colid=PZ2JDOJ3QCLO&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) . It does seem to be what I've been looking for but the fewer reviews and slightly negative ratings on their website make me not want to buy it, as some say it makes their scalp quite greasy contrary to what it is supposed to be. Maybe I'll still check this one out.

And yes, I need to avoid gels and creams totally, they are not helpful at all üòÖ  
This definitely gives me a start, thank you so much.
This is so helpful. Thank you. I also have Sjogren‚Äôs so my dry skin is next level. I‚Äôm going to try these things.
Tbh one thing I didn't knew is how your sleep cycle affect your skin ! Fr I started to get this bumps when my sleep cycle was fucked up for may be 20 - 25 days ! I was on my screen till 4 am and waking up at 1 or 12 ! Then one fucked up thing I did is use doxy ( antibiotics) cause I thought it's bacterial folliculitis+ I use tret ! I was so dumb ! I was previously also on antibiotics and recently diagnosed with molluscum contagium. But after I took fluconazole 150 mg and clometrizole and ketoconazole cream it is getting better ! I'll start Cetaphil after this whole fungal acne is gone ; idk how but I noticed forehead chest and back fungal acne only ! But hopefully it'll get better soon ! Any advice from your side ?
Thankyou so much.. your post helped a lot.
I have not heard any good reviews about Quench sugarcane squalane. I can‚Äôt risk my skin it‚Äôs fucked up these days. I am afraid to try ordinary also. Any idea if any sugarcane squalane could be bought ? Also, I tried glycerine mixed with rose water but it‚Äôs sticky. Can you suggest how to use sorbitol? Is it also sticky?
Yeah, I am currently using it, since I have oily skin, it makes my skin look very greasy but doesn't feel heavy and it hasn't triggered my fa
I had fungal acne so please stop now‚Ä¶.
that simpleskincare site started all this BS, the video i attached is her latest video on that topic. 
Treating something with science based approach instead of avoiding ingredients which are not backed by science. Hyram also used that site for reference. 
I am done here. You can continue writing long posts. Cheers
Same man! Deconstruct products are meh!! I have used some of their products and they don't live upto what they claim. Especially Niacinamide 5% serum I expected results it was just okayish. I am looking into better brands. Kbeauty has some but they are high end products which is not always possible.

Thank for the review on SA. It saved my money

I was in the look for ceramide moisturizer (fungal acne safe) as I have really dry skin and I have been using Carbamide forte mct oil which is 100% (C8 and C10) Then I saw this nykaa this moisturizer but since I have spent like 1000s on hit and trial method So I wanted a review over this ! :(
Oh my god, that is why it has been breaking me out, are there any fungal acne safe cleansers left?üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I use himalaya foaming neem face wash (It has polysorbate-20 but has not triggered my fa) but its very drying, do you have any recommendations? Any totally fungal acne safe gentle or even regular cleansers?
Life can't get any sadder ü•π
Yeah on my face.

I have never faced any issues with fungal acne. But recently when I changed my shampoo ie. Reequil hair fall control shampoo, I have noticed few fungal acne on my forhead.



Also I searched on the sub a lil on how to treat these. Will selsun anti dandruff shampoo will do the job?!
Thanks!!
I am also thinking to use luxura sciences MCT oil but I could not find it anywhere. Recently found it on Tata cliq but they sent me onion oil instead of MCT oil. So do you have suggestions for MCT oil brand or where can I find the luxura sciences one? Also, besides body cupid aloe gel is there any other aloe gel which I can try?
I tried Dr sheth's vitamin e cream and it causes me breakout then i search the ingredients on Skin Sort and it shows Liquid Paraffin as a fungal acne trigger.
Ohh ok thanks OP
Thanks for replying. 
Any recommendation for instant fairness cream that hide marks on face like Olay instant fairness cream?
How do you double cleanse?
I wanna try it in between shampoo days. My hair naturally has a lot of volume to the point they stick out. And I remember trying co washing when I didn‚Äôt have sd, they‚Äôd get more manageable and weighted down. 

It‚Äôs a strange hair type, smth like male asian hair. And I have short to medium hair length, so conditioning them would still get some of it on my scalp.

Btw, I use eucerin 5% urea calming shampoo, it‚Äôs pretty nice (contains urea and lactic acid). Also, I feel like, shampoo brush helps a lot and using warm water instead of hot. Another thing is using a shower filter if your water is hard. Be cause hard water is a big problem
Oh thanks! I've been using Sebamed clear face gel and my skin feels shiny and tight in a few minutes. Will try topping it up with boroline and see!

Thank you so much üôè, My skin was doing so good until winters came. Can you please link down Dermadew, and Treelogy is not available anywhere at this moment it is showing out of stock in every site, i was thinking of pairing it with MCT oil.
Do you still use MCT oil? If yes which one if you can share the link.
Sugar squalene oil is quiet expensive for me.
I use glycerine mist as first step for hydration, If treelogy is not available should i pair mct oil with aloe vera gel?
üôà‚ù§Ô∏è 

Not y'all spiritually testing my humility ü§£ü§£ü§£

Great! I'll format it, add relevant details and organize them üòå These look like great options, it's especially exciting to get new moisturizers on the list! Your efforts are so appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏èü•≥
Ohh... do the flakes still show or is it hidden/flake off?
Ah, makes sense, the Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Crram isn't fungal-safe. Thank you for sharing!
We should all be so lucky to have a friend like you ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôåüèº
My skin is doing pretty well RN, thanks. Fungal acne hasn't been a problem. It's being its normal acne-prone, sensitive self now üòÇüôèüèº

I use the Luxura Sciences MCT oil. Being derived from coconut oil doesn't cause any issues, IME, almost all moisturizing skincare products contains medium chain triglycerides (""capric/caprylic triglycerides"").

Edit: [Here's more details on how to choose a quality MCT oil](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/GhAPpmIjNn).
Same as you, I've seen people saying the filters used are unstable ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Doesn't mean it's useless, though.
Oh, good. Thanks for sharing!
Okay, thank you. :) I'll look into it.
Great! Thank youuu üôèüèº
Thanks for letting me know! I've added it to the list ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The Nivea Aloe gel lotion [isn't fungal-safe](https://incidecoder.com/products/nivea-aloe-vera-gel-body-lotion), neither is the Himalaya scrub ([ingredients here](https://incidecoder.com/products/himalaya-tan-removal-orange-face-scrub)).

The remaining products are fungal-safe üòÜüëçüèº I'm surprised at how many essential oils and fragrant compounds are included in Pears Body Wash, considering they market themselves as super gentle (would suggest those with sensitive skin and/or eczema, etc. to avoid), but most people like a fragranced body product and use them with zero issues ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The Dove shampoo is a nice find! I haven't explored haircare products all that much, so it's a welcome addition. Thanks for all your input, I really appreciate all the products y'all suggest!
I prefer the Clean and Clear one, because it's less drying, but it's hard to find online - I haven't noticed it in stores, either. But, really, the Himalaya one is what I'd suggest for oily skin. If you want more options, they're all on the list üôÉ I've linked reviews for the ones I've personally tried.

The Treeology moisturizer has ceramides, so it should suit sensitive skin. I have tried the Dr. Sheth's moisturizer and the Rahul Phate one, and reviews for both are linked.  TBH, even my suggestions are no guarantee of what will suit your skin. Ultimately, people's skin is different and reacts differently from each others'. You will not know for sure until you actually try a product ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That's why we always say YMMV on the sub (Your Mileage Will Vary)!

I would suggest you get your basic Cleanser - Moisturizer - Sunscreen routine in place before thinking about whether to add vitamin C or some other ingredient.  Basic skin health and sun protection can do a lot for the appearance of skin. Plus, adding too many products at once, especially for people with sensitive skin, isn't a good idea. If something doesn't suit you, you won't be able to say which product is the problem.

Take it one step at a time ‚ò∫Ô∏è
‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèº
Gotcha. Thanks! ‚ò∫Ô∏è I might try their SPF30 once I run out of my current indoor sunscreen - haven't tried Tinosorb S and M before, it's great they're formulating with new filters
If it doesn't claim to be waterproof or water-resistant, I would say single cleansing is fine. I've read that mineral susncreens can be hard to remove thoroughly, though, so I think it depends on the actual product and how it behaves - I suggest you watch some reviews
Plain squalane on a damp face ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I'm not entirely sure, because online sources are inconsistent... I've read that squalane is emollient and occlusive, but also a humectant. It's a great one and done for drier skin types.

And I always say, the most basic routine is to use a few drops of any oil that suits you, on a wet face, right after bathing. I do it with MCT oil on lazy days ‚ò∫Ô∏è
... Looks like they're the same company, yeah! Today I learned! I specifically use the Body Cupid aloe gel because it is (of course) fungal-safe, and I find it soothes my redness. More than the WOW one, which is apparently the same company. Go figure ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's also fragrance-free. 

I haven't tried their remaining products, and I'm not particularly interested. They seem quite strongly fragranced. I don't avoid fragrance altogether, just heavily perfumed stuff (not for skincare reasons, they just make me feel a bit icky). Besides that, they seem quite generic. There's better options for the face, at lower prices, IMO. For the body, they seem fine!

People who enjoy bodycare products for the fragrance and, you know, spa experience vibes, will probably be more into the brand. I'm nowhere near their target market ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thank you for the compliment! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I looked into the B5 more, and yup - [this blog post](https://www.thepinkvelvetblog.com/minimalist-vitamin-b5-moisturizer-review) has a shot of the back of the packaging with the ingredients list, and it contains stearates. Dammit. Minimalist don't do a single fungal-safe moisturizer. It's too bad. I'm surprised they publish an inaccurate list one the website, too.

Good for you, that XL Hydra doesn't aggravate your skin! Maybe you've recovered üòåüôèüèº

Here's the [Ordinary Squalane product page](https://theordinary.com/en-us/100-plant-derived-squalane-face-oil-100398.html), where it's specified to be derived from sugarcane
No, thank you for asking
Sure, thank you for asking
That serum seems pretty good on paper! TBH it's quite possible people are overusing it - scalp serums are to be used very sparingly, and it takes a while to get used to how much to apply. Rather than using the dropper directly, you may find it easier to control the amount by dispensing the same amount into your hand that you would apply on your face, and then rubbing that in with your fingertips.

Aloe gel is a good fallback option simply because there's less ingredients and it's easily available, multipurpose etc. If you try the serum, consider making a review post! You have me interested in it as well, now üòÇ
I'm so glad you find them helpful! It's a great relief to find what works. I have hEDS, so my skin heals really slow, dehydrates quick, and kinda ""matures"" a bit prematurely by mainstream standards. Figuring out how to best support my skin has been a relief and a pleasure - I wish the same for you as well ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è It's so nice to know how to care for oneself ‚ù§Ô∏è
Well, I guess my advice would be to sleep well üòÇ Soudns like you've figured things out, pretty much. Maybe dial back the frequency of your tret by a day or two and see if that helps, but I don't think it's necessary. Wait and watch, pretty much!

Are there any bad reviews? 

Anyway, I have a detailed post up on [moisturising with seb derm/""fungal acne""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/OI0gHSAdXE), I think you'll find that explains things more
Ayyyy! Good to know, thank you üôåüèº Added to the list
None of what you've shared contradicts the research collated on the SimpleSkincareScience blog, where each ingredient section links the relevant research articles.

I don't think that is any less science-based than solely going by the casual statement of a single dermatologist, especially when the context of what she said is more about marketing and less about ingredients. But that's my personal opinion, and anyone reading this post can see our exchange and make up their own mind ‚ò∫Ô∏è  

Cheers!
TBH, niacinamide 5% doesn't do that much in general üòÖ Some people just see better results with 10%, for example. Depends on your expectations... I wouldn't write off the whole brand based on just cleansers and one serum, because these particular products aren't intended to have dramatic results anyway. 

You could search for reviews on the sub about their other active serums. They might actually perform as claimed ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I just made an edit to my comment... I guess I'll try it after I finish my Re'equil ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I expect it will be very similar
Yup, this is a wiki post, no idea how it got removed...
Please do add it again, thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è Link where you found the ingredients if you can, that would be super helpful. 

~~I think it's showing prescription only because it's a pharma product, but there's nothing in there to cause any alarm, don't worry!~~

Edit: I take it back, contains Pramoxine Hydrochloride, which is an anti-itch medication. This is a medicated product, not a good idea to use without prescription and derm supervision
But Mct oil is not enough for my dry skin :(
I've added a new disclaimer - it's equally possible that the problem isn't the specific ingredient but that it leaves a residue that doesn't suit oiler skin types. 

I personally use Simple Refreshing Face Wash, and have found the Deconstruct salicylic face wash to also be quite gentle. Personally, I do feel the need for a foaming face wash, my skin is now combination-oily
Don't be too sad, this list was half as long last time I made it! There will only be more options in the future üòå

If you're looking for a similar product, I've been using the Minimalist 10% glycolic acid (the beginner exfoliating serum) for about three or four weeks, and it's been very nice!
Ah, yeah that's a sulphate-free one. If you have an oily scalp with dandruff, treating the dandruff will probably clear up your forehead... like, using good old Head & Shoulders plain black ‚ò∫Ô∏è And making sure to not go too long without shampooing. Plus, dandruff can be a cause of hair loss...

If you wanna stick with the shampoo and use an anti-fungal for your forehead only, then yeah. Selsun or similar anti-dandruff shampoos would be you go-to. Head & Shoulders is a slightly gentler option (more affordable, especially if you get a small bottle) but it may not work as well as Selsun.

One reason why you may be developing this is because the shampoo isn't removing as much oil as you need it to, so... maybe the shampoo just isn't enough. Or maybe you need to shampoo more often if you wanna use it ü§î
I hope they gave you a refund! Such a ridiculous delivery üòÇ

I think u/thesoapmaker_ who reviewed the Treeology72 moisturizer uses Sharret's MCT, so that's an option. As I've mentioned in the post:

>Any MCT that specifies ""C8-C10"", ""capric/caprylic triglycerides"" and ""keto"" should be fine. People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. 

I've personally used the Body Cupid aloe gel for years, and get the WOW one when that's out of stock. Haven't tried any others in the last few years ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The Treeology72 moisturizer doesn't seem to have any ingredients that would clog pores, IMO. It's fungal-safe, doesn't have fatty acids or anything. But of course, it's up to you what feels right and what you feel comfortable using.
Also , for treeology 72 moisturizer, I doubt will it suit my oily skin as it can clog pores.
Thanks for sharing! I checked it out, and Skin Sort doesn't link any further sources for that.

It sucks that it caused a breakout ‚òπÔ∏è TBH, even using too much MCT oil can cause breakouts for me in summer - the occlusion and heat is more than enough. I've added a note about occlusion in summer. A lot of people with fungal acne experience this, I've described how I avoid it in my [very first post about malassezia](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) under the ""technique"" section

>More important than anything else, even if you're using fungal safe products, you have to prevent your skin from becoming too hot and occluded. If the weather is hot AND humid, **YOU MAY NOT NEED ANY MOISTURIZER** If you ""seal"" it too much, it creates a greenhouse kinda effect, and it won't matter even if your products are safe, the fungal acne grows. Same goes for ""normal"" acne, to some extent.

I'd rather not take mineral oil/liquid paraffin off the list entirely, since it's an affordable option, and often works if used sparingly. Maybe you could try using a smaller smount of moisturizer on a wet face, but if you have active malassezia, I'd suggest sticking to a gel and MCT
Nope, sorry ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I use a DIY balm cleanser as a first cleanse (not fungal-safe), and a fungal-safe foaming face wash as a second cleanse
Oh, you have some more options that may feel and work better, like sugarcane squalane. I did a [detailed post on ways to moisturize with fungal acne/seb derm](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/ppzLaqNb9Q), you may find that useful!
[Link to Dermadew cream](https://www.1mg.com/otc/dermadew-aloe-cream-otc135542?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search). It's available on most shopping platforms, or local chemists. 

No idea about Treeology, sorry. I do still use MCT oil, just placed an order for the [Aiwo pure c8 one](https://www.amazon.in/Aiwo-Caprylic-Coconut-Source-Health/dp/B0CBQ298N9/ref=dp_prsubs_sccl_3/261-5230151-3054368?pd_rd_w=6EZGN&content-id=amzn1.sym.53341eab-8e64-44c3-a2e2-bac4dd2a6eeb&pf_rd_p=53341eab-8e64-44c3-a2e2-bac4dd2a6eeb&pf_rd_r=S89QE4SY2N9069Z67R4Y&pd_rd_wg=HpSwi&pd_rd_r=2d358630-b29b-4bda-b88e-3efe38830f6b&pd_rd_i=B0CBQ298N9&psc=1) but was formerly using the Luxura Sciences one. Squalane is definitely more moisturising, though, MCT is very light. May be fine for oily skin, but IDK, you may need something heftier because of tret.

You can pair MCT (or squalane) with aloe gel, sure. It's what I personally do when I get an allergic reaction or something. For more info on choosing an MCT oil, or how to moisturise in general, [I've made a dedicated post about tha](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/Uc6bp35BOx) ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Do you know any fa safe lipstick recommendations? Would help a lot. Not many posted anything about lipsticks in particular.
I barely get flakes anymore. One more id mention is I find that avoiding maida and dairy has made a huge difference!
That would do for now then. hahaa
[deleted]
I have an addition too, but I am not sure if it‚Äôs a 100% FA safe shampoo.

Sunsilk Coconut and Aloe Vera Shampoo
Hey! What about the VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash? Can you please tell me if its fungal acne safe or not? I've already checked but was surprised to see it's safe
I was very happy to find it too. Doesn't break me out. Doesn't irritate the eyes. No fragrance either.
I am currently using their vit c face wash . you mentioned there are better ones for lower prices. could you please tell those ? I am planning to switch from WOW.
Thanks!
>That serum seems pretty good on paper! TBH it's quite possible people are overusing it - scalp serums are to be used very sparingly, and it takes a while to get used to how much to apply. 

It indeed seems to be the case of over application, that it is making the scalp more greasy than to make it less so. 

>Aloe gel is a good fallback option simply because there's less ingredients and it's easily available, multipurpose etc.

Yeah, the cheapest option as well I assume.

And yes, I'll be buying that Minimalist serum, but hey I ain't big-time into Reddit posts, certainly not as good as you, I can drop a small review here perhaps. Thanks for the responses again.

Yes, I read at few places. Have you tried their sugarcane squalane? Also, I am thinking to try treeology moisturiser? Any idea will it clog pores? And it is also not available at any online platform these days, any idea?

I've added a whole lot of Nykaa products thanks to you ‚ò∫Ô∏è They've come out with a lot since I last saw.

Have you tried the Treeology moisturizer? In winter I always use Boroline Night cream as a final step, regardless of what else I'm using. Oil-free moisturizers can only do so much, as you say üòÖ A small amount warms up in the hands and lets you pat on a thin layer. Works great for me!

Squalane oil can be used the same way, if you're looking for something vegan and/or unscented (or ""non-comedogenic""). The Purito and Ordinary ones are sugarcane-derived, those are the safest bets. 

... make sure you're hydrating your skin well enough first, though, because barrier layers really dont do much if your skin is dehydrated as well. Even just plain glycerin on a wet face works!
No I figured out, olive oil derivatives were breaking me out earlier as well. 


The cleanser by simple is too stripping, leaves a film that‚Äôs difficult to wash off.

Yes, they refunded after so many calls and emails. :)
Thank you for replying. :)
Can you pls also answer one more question that if some product is fungal acne safe then is the product supposed to be bacterial acne safe ? Also, will it not clog pores and give closed comedones?
Thank you so much :) but I can not make this diy cleansing balm. Can you pls suggest a good sunscreen and any good first cleanser to clean it ? I've been looking for it since long but I could not find any. I have sensitive oily skin.

Added to the list! The moisturizer section is getting really long, next time I'm gonna have to organize it by texture or something üòÇüôèüèº These are the only ones I didn't add:

+ Aroma Treasures Lightening Pigmentation Gel (can't find ingredient list)

+ Dr. Sheths Ceramide & Vitamin C Brightening Oil-Free Moisturizer (because of the coconut alkanes)

+ Joy revivify hydra renew regenerate night cream (because of the milk lipids)

+ Haruharu wonder honey green aqua bomb cream (can't find ingredient list - tube or jar?)

I think it's best to leave products with known triggers off the list. The other Dr. Sheth ones look really interesting! And it's so cool that you found some actual creams and lotions üôåüèº
No, I don't have any... but a lot of liquid lipsticks don't contain any oils (unless they've added some to claim that it moisturizes), and matte lipsticks that don't transfer beyond the lip line shouldn't cause issues anyway? ü§î 

I've never had any issues with lip products, have you?
Ooh, gotcha! Yeah, I don't use INCIdecoder for the exact same reason üôåüèº They're especially inaccurate for Indian products. I go by brand website or back of the bottle. Totally saw the back of the Sunsilk conditioner instead of the shampoo on Google images üôÉ

Thank you so much for all the details and products! You've obviously taken great care in finding and checking them, so these are going straight on the list! Credit to you for founding the Bodycare section üòÇüôèüèº
It contains cetearyl alcohol, unfortunately - most haircare products do, including the Head & Shoudlers one I use ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seems to be fine for me, at least in combination with the zinc pyrithione that's in there, but not technically fungal-safe. That update about cetearyl alcohol really ruled out a LOT of products üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Thanks for the suggestion, though! ü•∞ I think I'll begin to expand the haircare section. I get asked about haircare quite a lot, and I wouldn't mind having some more options myself. A fungal-safe conditioner option would be great!
Yup, it appears fungal-safe - I went off images of the back of the tube ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèº Thanks for sharing!

Edit: says it has some glycolic acid, so I'd be cautious using it over the eyes. Even though I doubt it's a significant percentage
Sounds great! üòÜ Would you mind sharing your approximate skin tone and whether it leaves a white cast?
... you know, I think I was wrong about that üòÇ The Body Cupid is 100ml for 200 odd bucks on Myntra. Can't think of anything cheaper than that ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Can I ask why you want to switch? There's nothing wrong with using WOW products if they're suiting you...
Any kind of review post helps, not everyone has to nerd out to the max üòÇ Glad I could help!

I haven't tried it, no. The Treeology moisturiser is pretty light, there's a detailed review post of it. It didnt suit me because I happen to be allergic to an ingredient. No idea of availability
Thanks for the link! üòÜ Sounds like a couple of their products are quite nice...

I also religiously went by the 5% nicainamide rule, but one day I decided to give the Disrupt 10% a shot, and it worked really well üôÉ [(Review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/w6vzfe/review_disrupt_10_niacinamide_1_zinc_serum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 

Was soothing, helped with acne and healing... I think it's quite individual in its potential to cause irritation. The Ordinary 10% niacinamide is a cult product among so many people with acne, and my own experience bears out that anecdotal evidence. That's just my ten rupees on it, YMMV, of course. I know it's not the textbook advice ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Haha, just glad I can share the struggle! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nope, still using my UVDoux. Currently using a new indoor sunscreen though - the Vilvah SPF30 ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Silicone or water-based depends on HOW your skin is sensitive, plus lifestyle. If you're going out and gonna be sweating, silicone-based. You will have to double cleanse to take it off, but that's the point. It won't sweat off.

If you're staying indoors or mostly in AC, water-based is enough. But again, sensitive meaning? Some people are sensitive TO chemical sunscreens, and find them to cause eye stinging or whatever. Ultimately, you gotta try a few to know for sure üòÖ
Could you link where you found this list? The list I found on INCIDecoder is different ü§î
Ahh. So there's one ingredient that may be why it's prescription - Pramoxine Hydrochloride. It's an anti-itch medication. Not a steroid, but probably best not to use in a regular moisturizer ‚òπÔ∏è
I saw treeology but alcohols cause CC on my face ! Also Indulgeo Essentials has sugarcane derived squalane oil ! Squalane oil is also not enough for me :(
Well, you know best by trial and error. 

The Simple one, I find, works well if you take a small amount in wet hands and lather it well before using it on the face. No residue, and allows using of more or less ‚ò∫Ô∏è
If you find one that's fungal-safe, lemme know üòÇ Always happy to add to the list
Good for you! 

Products that are fungal-safe are usually fine for people with bacterial acne, since they're oil-free and don't contains fatty acids or esters, which are often the ingredients that break people out. There's a higher chance it will suit you, IMO, but it's not a guarantee üòÖ Like, even the comedogenic scale and their qholenidea of something being comedogenic has been somewhat discarded as an incomplete understanding of acne.

For example, with sensitive skin, using a product containing menthol can cause irritation leading to barrier damage leading to overgrowth of malassezia AND bacterial acne because off the lowered ""immunity"" of skin. But menthol isn't technically comedogenic, and it's fungal-safe. And silicones are fungal-safe, but some people find them pore-clogging when they're at a higher percentage ornin a heavier formulation.

I do think fungal-safe products usually suit OILY  acne-prone skin. It's one way of minimizing chances of a breakout... plus, reducing the malassezia helps with overall barrier function, which helps with reducing acne. The indirect effects on barrier function and inflammation can be pretty significant
I haven't tried a lot of sunscreens, TBH üòÖ UVDoux is my go-to for outdoors, it's silicone based and needs double cleansing. The Re'equil blue one is pretty similar, I've used that one too. It's slightly less spreadable than UVDoux, IME. 

Episoft AC was my indoor sunscreen, and I'm trying out the Vilvah SPF30 instead of that. You could try the Vilvah one, I think it might be good for sensitive skin, and definitely helps control oil.

I also haven't used a first cleanser apart from my DIY balm in years - I would suggest getting any of the ones that are popular on the sub. Like the Inveda cleansing oil.  Even though it's not fungal-safe, as long as you cleanse thoroughly with a foaming face wash afterwards, you shouldn't have any issues... that's guesswork on my part, but it's worked for me personally.

I've yet to find a first cleanser in oil or balm form that's fungal-safe, unfortunately. And wouldn't really recommend micellar water for sensitive skin, because it would take too much rubbing to remove silicone sunscreen.
All from my own experience, so I know how frustrating it can get ‚ò∫Ô∏è Glad you found it helpful!
Texture se yaad aaya, you wanted to see the texture of Moimax gel, I will send you today

Aroma Treasures lightening pigmentation gel (this is the ingredients list I had found)  ---  DM Water, Glycerin, Arbutin, Extracts of Aloe Vera, Liquorice, Chamomile, Lotus, 
Calendula, Hibiscus, Barley & Brahmi, Oils of Chamomile, Geranium, Vetivert & Carrot, Carbomer, 
Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide.

Haruharu ingredients (as on their Australian website, stylekorean has a slightly different ingredients list, that is also fa safe according to folliculitisscout)    ---    D.I. Water, Propanediol, Glycerin, 1.2-Hexanediol, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane, Sclerotium Gum, betaine, Hyaluronic Acid, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Tromethamine, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Saccharomyces Ferment, Lactobacillus Ferment, Honey, Caprylyl glycol, Benzyl Salicylate, Citral, Ethyl Linalool, Tetramethyl Acetyloctahydronaphthalenes, Methyldihydrojasmonate, Disodium EDTA, Cetyl ethylhexanoate, CI 61565 

I just saw now that haruharu has saccharomyces ferment and green tea ferment, I don't know if that can be used safely. And their Indian website mentions sunflower seed oil, I am really sorry, I should have checked better. I think we should not include this in the list. 

Thank you so much for the shoutout‚ù§Ô∏èü•π
Is joy safe for acne prone skin?
[deleted]
Warm beige skin tone, white cast is not that visible on me.
After seeing the bad reputation WOW brand has in this sub, I am having second thoughts on using it for long term. Just to be on safer side, i am planning to switch to other face wash like sebamed which are fungal acne free.
Lol alright, I'll let you know.
How do you get to know that you are allergic to one ingredient in particular product? And what that moisturiser did to you? Like you got acne or some reaction or what ? Because I am thinking to give it a try
Disrupt. Never heard of it. Surely will look for it.
Hi just to add, I checked on folliculitisscout and ekran sunscreen is fa safe.
How is vilvah spf 30 ? Did the soy milk extract in it aggravate ur fa? 
Also, for double cleanse,can we use micellar water as first cleanser and face wash as second cleanser?
https://www.apollopharmacy.in/otc/venusia-soft-plus-moisturizing-lotion100ml
Ohh I see, thank you for telling. I hope i find some other good moisturizer for dry skin for winters .
Oh, that's too bad about fatty alcohols ‚òπÔ∏è

.... if squalane isn't enough, no matter how much you apply, I'm pretty sure your skin is dehydrated ü§î Maybe give the glycerin thing a shot? Because when it comes to oil-water balance, if straight oil isnt working, it has to be not enough water ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Thank you for sharing so much of information:) 
Could you pls also help me with one sunscreen (mineral one) that do not require double cleansing to wipe off and also do not contain silicones?
I'll add the Aroma Treasures one and link the ingredients list ([this one, na?](https://www.salonmart.net/aroma-treasures-lightening-pigmentation-gel-50-gm)) ‚ò∫Ô∏è The Haru Haru one is too confusing üòÇüòÇüòÇ It's not your fault, just sucks when we can't find a somewhat reliable INCI list.

I'll add the Moimax texture also, if you send it... maybe next version of the list I'll link reviews and/or texture shots of products if they're available on the sub. That would be convenient ü§î 

Of course I'd shout you out, you contributed so much! This post wouldn't be so comprehensive without people like you keeping an eye out and sharing your finds üôèüèº
I haven't used that product myself. You could search the sub for reviews, though!
Thanks for contributing! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèº
I see! Thank you, I'm sure people will find that detail helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Ah, I see. Personally, I'd keep using it ‚ò∫Ô∏è WOW is a pretty established company, their products aren't gonna be _unsafe_ for use, they just may not be the best of the best. 

When it comes to face wash, it really doesn't make as much difference as with leave-on products. Most face wash formulations aren't even that different from each other. Basically, ""investing"" in a face wash isn't necessary unless you have super sensitive skin that has a reaction otherwise. 

The sub can sometimes be really all-or-nothing, especially when it comes to judging brands. Not every product from a brand has to be bad or good ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ... In fact, I'm almost out of face wash, and I'm considering getting one of the Body Cupid ones, now that we've discussed it üòÇüòÇüòÇ

If something suits your skin okay, there's no reason to switch. If you want to, that's okay too, obviously. But the judgement of people on the sub doesn't decide the reality of what happens with your skin, only you know that. Sometimes us skincare enthusiasts can be a little dramatic about things that don't make that much difference üòÖ
Over time, if my skin becomes sensitive and starts feeling raw or stinging. It takes a few days to see it happen, so you have to pay attention. Sometimes there's also bumpiness - not like acme, with properly raised bumps, but overall shallow bumpiness. And then with full irritation you get teeny tiny pinprick sized pustules.

People often mistake this for acne, but it's actually skin barrier damage. Basically your skin immunity has been put off balance. Using ""anti-acne"" strategies here only makes things worse.

That's a description of irritant dermatitis/barrier damage from your skin not liking a product or one ingredient. Mild allergies can do this. Severe allergies cause immediate reactions like welts and itching. 

It's trial and error to find if a particular ingredient doesn't suit you, you have to compare the ingredient lists of products that caused issues to spot the similarities.

If you're unsure and your skin is already quite irritated, I would stick to single ingredient options like aloe gel, glycerin and MCT oil until it calms down first, then reassess.
They have only two serums on the market, and I've reviewed both üòÇ I really enjoy them, I've almost finished my second bottle of their BHA.
Thanks, I'll add it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thanks, I'll add it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It has not aggravated my FA as of yet. But I haven't been using it regularly, so it'll take me a while to properly tell and give a review ‚ò∫Ô∏è It does feel a little like a coating on the skin, so for now I'm not telling people to run and but it!

Yes, you can use micellar water as a first cleanse - if you see my very first fungal-safe post I ever made, that's what I used to do. I had active fungal acne and was mid-treatment then. Couldn't use an oil cleanser without aggravating it.
>Pramoxine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic, which means it numbs the skin where it is applied to help minimize the sensation of itching and pain

From the [Cerave website](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/pramoxine-hydrochloride). It's not meant for regular use ‚òπÔ∏è Too bad. If they'd left it out, or made a version without that active ingredient it would've been a good option for a dry skin moisturizer
You're welcome. I haven't used a fungal-safe mineral sunscreen before, although there are a few I've added to the list. I've mentioned which ones are mineral. You'll have to do your own research there ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Hey, how do I send you the texture images, I made a video as wellü§≠
Ya. Exactly üíØ. But sometimes i wonder how WOW products are so cheap compared to other brands. That seems a little suspicious not that i want them to be expensive üòÇ. But you get my point. Better to use a brand that is being used by many rather than using one that's unpopular.
Actually same happened when I try Niamax d gel, Aziderm few days ago. It kind of damaged my skin. 
I think aziderm formulation does not suit me. 
I have mct oil from sharrets but whenever I apply it‚Äôs 2-4 drops I felt like I have got lot more small bumps on my skin. Do you think it can clog pores? Also I am looking for some silicone free sunscreen. Preferably mineral sunscreen . Have you tried Vilvaah melt in milk sunscreen? Also, any mct oil recommendations which is just C8?
And I have ordered purenso sorbitol liquid? Do I need to dilute it with water?
Thank you so much for replying to me.
Hopping on this convo to add that Disrupt actually has a couple of other serums! üëÄ I saw a HA serum on amazon- has a milky texture ü§§ also iirc, they have retinol too!
Thank you for letting me know
Does micellar water remove silicone based sunscreen?
Here I thought I have finally found something goodüòîüò™
I searched for aloevera gels. Most of them contain glycerin. I could only find one or two aloe gels without glycerin. Even the body cupid aloe gel contain glycerin. So is glycerin fa safe? I am sorry for asking so many questions :)
You can make an Imgur post and send a link to it (it's an image hosting website/app)
The more products you order from a manufacturer, the less the unit price - WOW is a full-on mainstream brand now. So they're probably making most of their profit from certain products, and using others as people's introduction to the brand. Like, all the ads you see online are for their haircare... They sell in stores, and I know it's super popular offline (and it's not cheap by any means). 

Skincare profit margins are generally pretty large, and the bigger the company, the more units they sell, the cheaper they can price their products. Especially with stuff like face wash, which is quite a standard product, and doesn't take any special R&D or something. Like, white labelling is quite common... I wouldn't use their serums or whatever, but face wash, sure. The only potential flaw to me is, I use their Aloe gel, and they use the same tube. I feel like it might spit out too much face wash? ü§î

You tell me üòÇ Does it smell very strong? Does too much face wash come out of the tube?

The sub is a very specific demographic of people, regular consumers love the brand ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It sounds like you have barrier damage, yeah. You'll find most of your questions answered in that moisturising post I linked ‚ò∫Ô∏è That's all my experience shared in an organised way.

I have used the Vilvah sunscreen in SPF30 and 50, if you use the search bar, you'll find that post.
üòÜ Thanks so much for letting us knowwww! 

I just bought a hydrating product, and I have no plans to start a retinoid for now. But when I run out - ‚Çπ295 is the absolute MOST anyone should be paying for a 30ml HA serum at this point üò§ Adding it to the list!

... unfortunately, it seems the HA and retinol are the only two products available RN, and the niacinamide and salicylic serums are OOS üôÉ Ah, well. They're a small company, I suppose it takes time to restock.
Takes some practice, but yes. You really have to saturate whatever cotton pad or fabric you're using. 

I used to use one of those reusable cotton rounds, those are really absorbent so one was enough. You'd need at least two-three cotton rounds if youre using the disposable ones. And you really have to have it wet with micellar water. Using less micellar water will just make it drag, and it won't take the sunscreen off, either.
Me, too! üò≠ It's okay, though - it was a really good find otherwise üòå‚ù§Ô∏è
Glycerin is fungal-safe, yes - [this blog post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/glycerin-fungal-acne-safe-malassezia/) explains it in depth"
Nivea Derma Skin Clear Deep Pore Cleanser,Best Products for Common Skin Concerns Series: OILY SKIN and ACNE,"Second in my series aimed at compiling recommendations offered from members of the AB community for addressing common skin concerns. If you missed it, the first of the series can be found here: [ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)

Products, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped.
I have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.

Please feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for acne isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction


**PLEASE NOTE:** *What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with cystic and comedonal acne and breakouts. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time.*

*IF YOU HAVE A FEVER, SEVERE HEADACHE OR NECK STIFFNESS, EYE IRRITATION, LIP OR OTHER FACIAL SWELLING, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.*

**For those of you experiencing hormonal outbreaks**, its important to communicate this with your healthcare provider. Hormonal acne may be a sign of other endocrine/hormonal issues that should be evaluated by a medical professional. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues of hormonal imbalance.

**Another Note:** This list proved quite difficult to compile, given that many contributors with oily/acne-prone skin are using multiple actives and/or retinoids to treat their skin. As such, many use products to restore a depleted moisture barrier that may prove far too heavy for someone with oily skin who is NOT using these treatments. I strongly urge use of this list merely as a starting point, and advise looking at the original threads for additional details. In the meantime, I do plan on doing a separate post for ""tretface,"" overexfoliation, or an otherwise damaged moisture barrier, so stay tuned!

&nbsp;

**DO'S/DON'TS**

* Give products time and don't switch around to quickly. It can be easy to want a quick fix, but most products that address acne or problem skin take TIME and consistency.

* Remember even if you are generally acne free, you can still get a breakout now and then and it doesn't mean the products have failed. It's better to look at acne in an overall general improvement kind of way, rather than all or nothing, otherwise you are going to feel like you're failing constantly (u/TrishBrennan) 

* Make sure to rule out dehydration/compromised moisture barrier as the cause of your acne. Acne can be caused by many things (diet, allergy, hormones, even fungus!) but the easiest version to cure is the one caused by dehydrated, overworked skin. (u/Daheep)

* Be careful to avoid overexfoliation, which can make your acne worse. Many acne patients, especially those familiar with the classic Western medical approach to acne can be over-exuberant with their exfoliators, leading to a compromised moisture barrier, which can lead to more reactive skin. The AB (and in many ways, SCA) approach is far more gentle, aiming to treat acne-prone skin with hydration and only using as much exfoliation as necessary. 

* **Stop all other actives when starting prescription acne treatments,** namely chemical exfoliants or any other potentially irritating parts of your routine.

* Make sure you have a solid base routine with a good moisturizer before starting prescription treatment, as many prescriptions can rapidly and drastically deplete your moisture barrier. **A healthy moisture barrier is critical to clear skin.**

* Sometimes it's not about ADDING something, but about ELIMINATING an offending ingredient. Try to identify what products and ingredients help your skin and which seem to make it worse. Sometimes acne can actually be irritation in disguise.

* If starting a retinoid/rx medication/AHA, **USE SUNSCREEN**

* Many ABers will swear by techniques and approaches that may seem counter-intuitive to the unintitiated, such as using oil cleansers as a first step, applying facial oils, and moisturizing the skin. People with oily skin general fear oils in most of their forms, so it can be difficult to feel comfortable applying oils to the face or moisturizing creams. That feeling is normal, feel free to try different suggestions and techniques depending on comfort level, but try to keep an open mind. 

* Check your make up application tools (brushes, Beauty Blender) - these may be a source of bacteria and mold that could be at the route of your skin problems. Make sure you wash these tools thoroughly and regularly and let dry completely between uses.

* Sanitize your cell phone

* Change your pillow case twice a week or use a t-shirt over your pillow

* Use new face towel every day

* Avoid picking or touching your face (hydrocolloid patches can help with this)

* Practice positive affirmations

* If you want to truly mimic how they do things in Korea, go see a dermatologist, especially one that specializes in aesthetic dermatology. Koreans are much more likely to see a dermatologist for even minor breakouts. Of course, accessibility and affordability are an issue for many, so of course, this may be easier said than done. 

* Get some sleep already!

&nbsp;

**EDITORIAL COMMENT** This is the topic that is probably covered the most thoroughly here on Reddit, giving that the demographic likely skews younger. After reading through thousands of comments and posts on this topic, the major takeaway for the AB approach to acne is to use an Asian-style routine (double cleansing, multiple hydrating layers, gentle approach, use of whitening/brightening products that also have anti-inflammatory effects) in conjunction with prescription medications. Retinoid based treatments can be very harsh on the skin's moisture barrier, and lucky for those of us who are AB enthusiasts, we have multiple tools at our disposal to replenish lost hydration and provide the necessary occlusion to keep that moisture in the skin. While you can of course try maxing out your OTC exfoliation, the fastest route to clear skin is very likely going to be to see a dermatologist, and then using your AB routine to deal with the aftermath. **Many, many respondents have said that the single most effective change that cleared their acne was seeing a dermatologist**

My main issue is no matter what I add or take away I don't really see any difference at all so I guess I need to explore the RX path.
the point about taking stuff OUT of your routine is so key. things that have a 0 comedogenicity rating can absolutely cause breakouts for an individual person, including plant oils (""natural"" doesn't mean less pore trouble, as i have learned the hard way)!
[deleted]
Could you please add some products for acne prone skin?  

Those products are not popular as the other products mentioned since it is not hype about.
**Himalaya Neem Gel Cleanser**-oil skin ph5.5
**Chica Y chico Line**-very gentle for acne prone skin
**Pure Marula Oil**-really good for acne&reducing redness

Ingredients
**Centella Asiatica**-this is really good to reduce inflammation for those that can't use tea tree 
**Neem**- an Aryuveda herbs for reducing acne for oily skin
OMG! Thank you for this! xD
would add few products that visibly helped me to balance my hormonal breakouts and oilyness:

klairs toner from wishtrend - contains licorice and other gread ingredients. I was amazed how great this toner worked for me.

freshly squized vitamin drops from wishtrend - 5% vitamin c , centella. the effect is not from vitamin c , but from all the ingredients as a whole. I use it as a serum , not as an active.

using emulsions as daily AM moistureses , instead of my regular gel creams. Currently I use Swanicoco, and waiting for COSRX.


Using lighter face oil - these days I use Goodal camellia water oil instead my regular banilla oil essence and Goodal waterest oil.

Sheet mask ‚Äì I would add Leaders AC dressing mask from Mediu line. It's cheaper than Insolution line (which is also very good), but the Mediu has more acids and to me it works better. But, again, both AC masks are very good.

I also like leaders  PORE-SCALING BLACK AQUA  black mask from step solution line. 



Would just like to share my makeup routine for my very oily skin (and I'm living in a hot and humid climate too):

1. **Hada Labo Gokujyun Light Lotion** (this is my entire ""skincare"" routine for the AM, anything more makes my face sticky by mid-morning)
2. **Kose Sekkisei Sun Protect Essence Milk** (HG sunscreen, been trying to find something cheaper that can control my oiliness as well as this one can but no luck so far)
3. **Sofina Primavista Long Keep Base UV** (HG primer, keeps me matte till mid-afternoon)
4. Best base makeup combo: **Revlon Colourstay Liquid Foundation** + **Chacott Finishing Powder** (keeps me reasonably matte ALL DAY)
5. Powder foundations (when I'm in a rush): **ZA Perfect Fit Two-way Foundation**, **Cezanne UV Foundation EX** 
I can't believe no one has mentioned the **It's Skin Power 10 Formula VB Effector!!** This is witchcraft in a bottle for me. Unreal oil control for hours, and I live in a tropical, humid country where the seasons are hot and hotter.

&nbsp;

**The Face Shop Real Nature Mung Bean Sheet Mask** is my favorite for treating breakouts. Acne is smaller and less inflamed the next day.

&nbsp;

**The Face Shop Rice Cleansing Oil** is a 4/5 for me with the only con being the strong scent. I love how this makes my face nice and soft without leaving that gross, oily film. Looking at you Biore cleansing oil.

&nbsp;

Not a single product thing, but I mix **Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel** with a local TTO to spot treat, and it can dry out any breakout overnight.

&nbsp;

Thank you so much for doing the AB gods' work!! This has inspired me to do like a science-y posts compilation type. I'll have to message the admins, and actually need to find time for it, but definitely want to make it happen :)

This series is an amazing feat, I can't imagine the time it took to compile, so thank you! My one suggestion would be to add a disclaimer re using spearmint tea. The hormonal imbalance causing acne may be a symptom of an underlying diagnosis that needs proper medical attention, or it could be that acne is the only symptom of that slight hormone imbalance but that disrupting those hormones via spearmint might lead to other problems e.g. menstrual cycle changes. People should speak to their doctor before self-medicating their hormones since they're responsible for a lot more than acne. Or you could [add this blog link](http://www.fanserviced-b.com/skincare-routine-for-hormonal-cystic-acne/) that has disclaimers in it to the list? You rock for putting this all together!
I have been trying to double cleanse with the kose softymo deep cleansing oil, and I really find that it doesn't do much for removing makeup on my face. I switched to banilaco clean it zero and it's wonderful! Just my experience! üòé
>(edited for grammar)
Thank you so much for curating this list of products and information! The amount of time it must have taken is incredible. I just wanted to add that, a few months ago, I created a post about [things and habits that keep my skin clear](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4cn3s9/simple_things_and_habits_ive_noticed_that_help/?ref=share&ref_source=link). I am more on the combo/acne side rather than oily/acne side... but the points I made and the comments added to that post are still very relevant and helpful for myself (as I imagine many other ABers who deal with acne). Here's the post:  
>I was just looking over the sub, and although this post might not be totally AB-centric, it involves AB. A little background about me first:    
  
>&nbsp;  

>I got into AB at the beginning of July last year (2015). You might remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3bospx/tomorrow_is_july_1st_i_am_making_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link) if you were involved in the community at the time. The point is, my skin likes to be babied. It doesn't like being poked, picked, scratched, rubbed, chafed, or abused. I've had acne since I was 12 years old. Yes, 12. I was still in 7th grade at that time. My acne was mild then, but it has noticeably progressed over the years, and became hormonal during high school (around my junior year, IIRC.) I always thought that using products that would dry my skin out would clear up my acne for good. I abided by Western skincare practices, and used an exfoliating face wash, astringent toner, and light moisturizer, followed by a benzoyl peroxide spot cream. If I didn't have a spot treatment, I would dab rubbing alcohol or tooth paste on my pimples. Did that type of routine work? Yeah, but only for the first week... and then my skin would become terribly dehydrated, flaky, sensitive, and red. I was on my high school swim team, and I would have practice every weekday for about 2 hours. As soon as I got out of the pool, I would reapply my makeup and go home instead of washing my face since I was so embarrassed of my acne. I would frequently sleep in my makeup and wouldn't wash my sheets more than once every two months. I would pick my skin almost daily, and then not wash my face after picking for sometimes hours. Basically, my skincare habits were terrible and unsanitary. I didn't consistently follow my routine, and I slept in my makeup.   
  
>So fast-forward a few years... I'm now in my early twenties and I have a well-established skincare routine that centers around AB and AB practices. The most clearly-defined Asian skincare practice being to keep my skin hydrated, even if it's oily. I follow my routine religiously, and when I don't, I sheet-mask or use an extra amount of my Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream ;) Since sticking with my routine, my acne has significantly cleared up and my skin has become brighter, glow-ier, and smoother.   
   
> &nbsp;  

>**I just wanted to share with the community that I've noticed simple things over the past year or two that have immensely helped keep my skin clear. Here they are (finally):**   
 
>* Do not pick, squeeze, scratch, or dig at your pimples or skin if you can help it    
* Keep track of your progress with picking at your skin with an app; stay accountable for picking    
* If you've got a pimple or whitehead that's about to pop or come out, wash your hands/sanitize them first and then LIGHTLY pop the pimple; immediately put a hydrocolloid bandage on it  
* Keep your sheets (and especially your pillowcase) clean; wash them at least once or twice a month  
* Do you morning skincare routine daily and don't skimp on the sunscreen    
* Don't reapply powder makeup more than once in a day; instead, blot with a tissue or paper towel or toilet paper and then lightly swipe or dab over it with a makeup brush or sponge that has nothing on it to fix the finish  
* If you wear makeup, wash it off nightly and continue with your nightly routine    
* If you *really* can't do your entire routine, at the very least: cleanse with a cleansing water/wipe and put your active or prescription on followed by at least one moisturizer or emulsion  
* Try to be cognizant of your hand placement during the day, and keep your hands away from your face as much as possible, especially if you haven't washed them or used hand sanitizer   
* Research the ingredients in all the products you would like to buy BEFORE you buy them and take note of the ingredients your skin is sensitive to  
* Write down your current routine somewhere and record your skin's progress using pictures, qualitative analysis, or quantitative analysis (by this, I mean count the number of pimples on your face at a point in time and record it) and try to determine whether or not your skin gets better or worse when a new product is introduced or an old product is thrown out  
* Introduce only one new product at once, and use it for at least 2 weeks before introducing another new product (because who am I kidding? Patch-testing takes way too much patience when it comes to acne breakouts... if I breakout after a new non-active product has been introduced, I'll know the product doesn't work for me and I'll stop using it)  
* Be patient with active products and prescription products; they can take weeks or months for your skin to adjust to, depending on their strengths; don't give up if they cause an initial purge or breakout  
* Tailor your day-to-day moisturizing routine depending on how hydrated your skin feels   
* Pay attention to your skin a day or two after using a sheet mask; if it looks like it's bright and clearer than usual, use another sheet mask that week; if it looks dull or the texture feels ""off,"" give your skin a breather and wait until the following week to use another sheet mask (YMMV for this one: I've noticed I get tiny whiteheads if I sheet mask too often in one week)  
* Go to sleep around the same hour consistently and don't mess with your sleep schedule if you can help it; my skin breaks out when I don't have a regular sleeping schedule; try to get the same amount of rest every night (that could be 5 hours of sleep or 8 hours of sleep; just keep it CONSISTENT)  
* Wipe down surfaces your face or hands touch regularly with a sanitizing wipe (phone, car steering wheel, hand sanitizer bottles, desks, laptops or cases, closet doors, handles, bathroom counters, etc.)    
* Use prescription oral medications if your acne is hormonal (e.g. spironolactone, birth control, accutane, etc.)  
* Can't emphasize this enough, but use sunscreen daily if you're going out (even to work or school)  
  
>---     

>Suggestions from other users:    
>
* If you think your acne could be hormonal, make an appointment to see your doctor. Don't be stubborn like I was and needlessly suffer with acne. It has made a huge difference in my skin's texture, softness, and of course clarity. I wish I had started taking spironolactone years ago. (*from u/marmot33*)  
* I would also like to add drinking lots of water, I noticed my skin gets very congested if I'm dehydrated (*from u/feverrayz*)    
* washing sheets/pillowcases: You really should be doing this once a week, especially if you use hair products. So much dirt and oil builds up, not to mention sweat and facial products. My tip: flip your pillow over every night (clean side!) And change it once a week. And get some silk ones! You'll thank yourself when you're old like me. (*from u/misspiemisspoke*)  
* If you're a chronic picker (like me) I'd recommend getting acrylic tips! They might not be for everyone, but I've found being physically unable to pick my skin is the only way I stop. Team no self-restraint over here haha. (*from u/AnthonyJCrawly*)  
* instead of popping, get some lancets from a pharmacy. they're basically teeny scalpels and make a nice clean cut that heals better than the tear of a pop. lancet are about 8$for 100. (*from u/IWankYouWonk*)  
* My tip: Wash your hands well before bed and if you put handcream on make sure that it's not something that will make you break out if you accidentally transfer some of it to your face while sleeping. (*from u/pennypoppet*)  
* Something that I've found that works for me is also exercising. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week now and my skin has been noticeably clearer. It's usually clear, but I would get the occasional pimple. This has not happened since I starting gymming more frequently the last 3 months (*from u/AlphaBaby*)
  
>&nbsp;    

>I probably have more somewhere stored deep in my brain but those are the suggestions that come to mind at the moment. Keep in mind, these are things that I've personally noticed over the last year that have improved my acne. I'm currently 85% clear and am in love with the texture and brightness of my complexion. I still have a little more progress to make with becoming totally clear, but compared to a year ago, my skin is doing fantastic and I couldn't be more grateful to this community and the wonderful source of knowledge its users have been :) All hail the snail!  
   
> &nbsp;    

>*P.S. If you have any other simple tips you'd like me to add to the list, please leave them in the comments!*
As with many things, YMMV. Evening primrose oil caused my acne to worsen so I would recommend against it for acne prone individuals.

What an amazing compilation!! Thanks so much for dedicating time and resources to this. I already use a few of these products and am on a no-buy for a month until I add in better actives than what I have currently, but this list is really positive and helpful. (I also know my skin better than I'd really like to, haha, it took me about three years to really nail it down.)
Thanks!!! This is AMAZING/Also any tips/products that quickly wipe out a pimple and the redness? I see them coming and want to know if I can stop them in their tracks!
‚ù§ this post is everything I've been looking for
YAYAYAYA! 
I feel like the skinfood peach sake pore serum did NOTHING for me. I actually think it clogs up my pores then actually ""minimize"" them. I hate the thick consistency it has when I apply it on the areas needed.
Wow!! Great information for this ab newbie. Thanks!
Thank you so much for this! It heartens me to see products I am using in this list and also I am now going to use this as a ""shopping list"" of sorts. Very Very appreciative of your work.
This is a really great post. As someone with oily af skin, I read the product list and went, ""yep, use it, yep use it, yep, yep, yep"". This is a really fantastic resource for people who are lost, thank you for doing this!
Hi! I have a small question, you mentioned using the **Innisfree Green Tea line** but you didn't list any of the products from that line among the different skincare categories, is there a reason for that? Thank you for the list!
you must add cosrx oil free ultra moisturizing lotion! this has been very popular 
This is amazing. Thank you for doing this. (Seriously, I clicked this thread thinking it was going to be another newbie asking what products work best for their skin with acne with no other information, and was totally blown away by this.)

Thanks for taking time out to compile the products and for the helpful tips and advice! 
Thank you so much for dedicating your time to put this together for the community! 
This came just in time for my first mini-haul, god bless you.
There should probably be an annotation that this has been discontinued. Which is so massively disappointing :(

‚Ä¢ Mizon AHA 8% Peeling Serum
This post is amazing! Bookmarking it and going to make it my new go-to guide :D I've been looking for things similar to my Drunk Elephant stuff!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! You absolutely rock for taking the time time put this together!
Fabulous list. 
I would also add eliminating offending foods. Sugar for example.
Is there a way this can get pinned to the side bar for easy reference? I printed it off but also know it is continuously being updated so. 
From your travels into the world of acne mountains and oily streams, do you have an idea of what might be common irritants for this type of skin?

I'm pretty sure my chin is developing more CCs than usual and I'm at such a loss... it seems like it was such a slow development I didn't notice it at first... I use snail, honey, AHAs, BHAs, niacinamide, high linoleic acid oils, tea tree, and obviously a lot more ingredients. I just don't even know what to start eliminating to see if I can find a trigger for my issues.
Drinking lots of water and taking a break from my consistent AHAs and BHAs was the best thing I did for my skin. I saw really noticeable results within a week. My face and wallet are much happier now ;)
thank you so much for this! you're a lifesaver! now if only I could find some of this here in the Phils. :D

anyway, can you possibly add cushion foundations and the like? they're extremely popular now and I would like to know which are great.
This is so helpful! Thank you so much
May I also recommend the AC Clinic Daily / Intense skincare range from Etude House? I use the cleanser, toner, gel lotion and the pink powder spot (topical acne treatment), which contain salicylic acid and are all non-comedogenic. 
I've also been experiencing cystic/underground acne more often than other types of acne and will highly recommend seeing your local Chinese doctor who will prescribe you with TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) in the form of herbs which you can then boil/cook into a bitter tea/soup. It may be very bitter so a good idea to hold your nose and eat Hawthorne flakes afterwards. TCM can be used to relieve the ""heatiness"" in your body, also known as expelling the toxic substances in your body that is causing your acne. I personally found it very effective and will highly recommend to those who have access to a Chinese/Asian doctor - I live in Hong Kong, for those who may wonder. 
This is awesome, thanks!

I also have a mask suggestion: Innisfree It's Real Squeeze mask in Bija is a godsend for when my face is breaking out. It's one of the few sheet masks that doesn't break me out (I attribute this to the fact that it's for acne, not moisturizing, the latter of which my oily skin does not need).
Naruko Tea Tree Sunscreen is great for oily-acne prone skin.

Korean Tinted Sunscreen for Black Girls - Beauty of Joseon
https://youtu.be/haAtNummIEM
Thank you so much for this well written, informative, and beautifully organized post. As someone who struggled with acne for years when I was younger, this would have been a treasure trove of advice!  
Love this
Ugh, I'm so conflicted because I hear so many great things about both but I also hear that snail clogs pores :/ 
Not buried at all! I'll add it and thanks for contributing!
Fantastic - thank you for these additions and your help on rosacea and redness post the other day. I will add them now!
Thank you! Will incorporate now
Hi can you tell me the difference between the Goodal camellia water oil and the waterest oil? I actually have dry-combination skin so pretty much the opposite as this threads's concerns but I am using the banila essence oil and the goodal waterest oil and I'd love to know your thoughts on how you use these three products! 
>  It's Skin Power 10 Formula VB Effector

Glad to know it worked well for you. I wondered why it was marketed as oil control, because *for me* it was a disaster. It stang and made me oilier.

> The Face Shop Rice Cleansing Oil

I like it too and yeah, I don't like the smell at all. I find it very easy to rince off too, which doesn't break me out, unlike oil cleanser that are harder to rince off.
I'm so happy to hear it and **thank you** for contributing (I'm adding your products now)! All I've done is compile - its really the work of everyone who has answered these questions time and again. The more people chime in, the more comprehensive we can make it! It's hard because, of course, YMMV, but at least these lists can help give people somewhere to *start.*
:o  I have been looking at my Benton TT mist the last few days and not knowing what to do with it.  I thought it was just supposed to be a refreshing spray, I never thought to use it as a toner.  I am not a smart woman >.>
I also want to say, on a personal note, that the popularity of spearmint tea/capsules rather than very low dose spironolactone in this community is slightly disturbing. I know that Tracy/fanserviced-b has her own reasons for not wanting to address her hormonal acne with medical treatment (ETA: and, of course, that is an issue between her and her doctor), but I personally feel like her stated reasons and description of spironolactone to the community at large  have instilled a fear of a very low-dose medication that is extremely effective for many. But I have avoided editorializing as much as possible in these posts - the honest truth is I am a physician, and therefore have a bias in favor of pharmaceutical, prescription treatments that have significant, randomized-controlled trial clinical evidence over ""natural"" treatments that I know is not shared by all. 
Yes the disclaimer at the beginning was too general, thank you for mentioning it. I will add to it, because the entire point of this post (and honestly, the series in general) is FOR SURE for people to see a doctor for their stubborn skin problems - I mean, granted, I'm biased when it comes to that ;)
Same experience with the deep cleansing oil! It did actually cause some acne flare-ups for me, I think. Maybe because of the mineral oil?
Oh interesting. I hadn't come across that complaint, and both the Deep and Speedy Kose Cleansing Oils are so popular around here. Now that you've brought it up, I wonder if we'll hear from other people with the same experience. 
Woah! I'm so sorry I missed this! I will try to add anything I've missed, and thank you for sharing your journey. You should be proud of what you've accomplished so far. I personally ascribe to a few aphorisms that may seem trite, but are important to me:

1) We are *all* works in progress

2) We're all doing the best we can, but we can all keep trying to do better

Finally, there is no perfect. My hope is that AB can help people recognize the beautiful skin they have - we tend to focus on the blemishes, and forget to notice the rest!
Absolutely. By the same token, the items listed with the most supporting evidence (the prescription meds) definitely don't work for everyone. I see the lists as kind of a menu - things that you can select from that have worked for others with *varying degrees of success.* With the exception of Accutane (which I think is probably the probably most effective, but, of course, associated with the most extreme side effects and certainly not for everyone) nothing is for sure going to clear up everyone's acne. Sadly :(
AWESOME, I <3 this. Adding this info!
Hi! Question for ya: would you say that the linoleic vs. oleic acid concerns also apply to the rest of the body (like for body lotions/creams)? Body acne and treating it can be a little different compared to how to handle facial acne and while I don't have to deal with body acne on the regular, I figure maybe some of us out there might.
Great question! To answer it, I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4anozp/so_what_do_you_do_when_you_get_a_pimple/) - I'm in the process of incorporating some of this info into the post. 

Overall, the answer seems to be sheet masks with soothing ingredients (Benton Snail Bee is a popular choice), tea tree, BHA, and, most popularly, **hydrocolloid bandages**
It's because that line is specifically made to counter oily-combo acne prone skin. The **Balancing Lotion** is pretty hyped and I actually have it too but to be honest, it doesn't actually do much but provide moisture. It possibly helps control oil production in a small way but it does not reduce acne in my experience. If you need a light moisturiser and don't mind strong fragrances, do give the balancing lotion a try. Otherwise, there are much better ones that fit the bill.
It's there! Listed under ""Brands/Product lines"" - and its in **bold!**
Will do!
Oh no! I hope the title isn't misleading - I'm loathe to change it because I wanted the title to be consistent with the first I published in this series on redness and rosacea. 
Take a look at Roseroseshop and Testerkorea to compare prices -- these places are usually the cheapest. Most actives will brighten skin in conjunction with regular sunscreen use, but my top picks would be vitamin C, arbutin, and mandelic acid peels (I use the one from MUAC). 
Shark Sauce has a really strong reputation for brightening effects, although it's not considered an active. But almost all of the actives listed (except for clindamycin, which is an antibiotic/anti-inflammatory) will help brighten pigmentation by either exfoliating or encouraging faster skin cell turnover.
I know! I did google everything (or at least tried to) before adding it to the list.... I mean when I last searched for it you still score a bottle on AMazon Prime for alike $80. But I just checked and, yup, no dice. I'm removing all discontinued products, because I want this to be up to date. Lots of people with problem skin loved Joseon cream - note that I didn't list it ;)

Buh bye, Mizon AHA! You will be missed!
Ha! I just happened to be on here and saw this. What kinda update you lookin for?
You're very welcome, and thank you for your lovely compliment!
I haven't had that problem personally.
Benton Steam Cream samples are easily available. Try it out and see what happens! If it doesn't work then at least you're not wasting too much money/ product. 
Clogs pores or, causes some to breakout? Those are different things. 
I'm not sure if this is backed by science but I've heard that there is a correlation between people with dust allergies and bad reactions to snail. 
Mizon Snail Recovery Gel broke me out, and it took me forever to figure out that it was the culprit. I would get four or five tiny whiteheads on my chin every time I used it.
never heard that... steam cream + the recovery gel both have other ingreds that can clog some ppl. ie there are snail products that can clog pores. but snail mucin itself is not very likely to. I use and love cosrx 96
I hadn't heard that either! In fact, a lot of people in the threads I linked to recommended snail-containing products to help heal their acne-scarred skin *without* clogging their pores. I'll keep an eye out for further information on this, because that sounds like an important piece of information. 
You are welcome =)  .  I really love Centella Asiatica but it is such a hard ingredients to find T_T
camellia is the most leightweight watery gel serum not really an oil , but there is oil ectract. i use it on  under eye area and neck on summer, on the whole face at winter. it doesnt contain niacinamide and i use it in vitamine c routine
Thank you for saying this. There is too much self-diagnosing, I read it on the internet~/WebMD'ing sometimes and it really bothers me.
I had a Curology derm recommend spearmint to me for hormonal acne and I take it now.  Im also on levonorgestrel birth control and was a little freaked about messing with my hormones even further. I could thankfully ask the Curology derm if it was ok to take the spearmint in conjunction with my bc. I couldn't imagine just blindly taking supplements that could alter my body chemistry. On the other hand, I have health insurance and it still took me 2 months to get a Gyno apptmnt even while I was having extreme pain. So I kinda understand people's need to find results but shiiittttt, messing with hormones is scary.
I've actually had a primary care doctor from a few years ago (only no longer bc I moved) prescribe both spiro and spearmint tea/capsules to me; I've never understood it to be something that's either/or. (Haven't been on this sub long enough to gauge whether it's either/or around here). I do appreciate your context / note about this though! 
I think it might be giving me flare-ups, too. :( I really wish I had bought a decant instead of the full size. I was trying to be so careful, too--I checked CosDNA and everything... oh well. I did like the smell and the texture, and it worked decently for me as a makeup remover.
Also, forgot to mention, but it might be especially good for acne-prone skin people who also use prescription: linoleic acid also helps to prevent transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and repair skin barrier function ([source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7373078)).
I'm not 100% sure, but I would guess that, even if body skin tends to be less sensitive than the one on the face, skin is skin, so it shouldn't be *drastically* different.
THank you SO MUCH!!! I see those small ones starting and wanted the wipe out those little whiteheads before they become so big!
Okay i'll give it a try :) thanks!
I know its there!! And thats why I clearly wrote ""you mention using the **Innsifree Green Tea Line** !!!!
""series"" is a good tip-off!
I think I just missed series when I was reading on mobile!
Clogs pores specifically. I'm sure anything will break somebody out, I had just heard it mentioned a few times by people with large pores that snail can clog em up. I'll probably just have to try it out for myself though. 
Snail is definitely a weird ingredient. This is just anecdotal, of course, not scientific, but when I get a few tiny whiteheads on my chin around my period, the regular Mizon AIO knocks them out in a day or two without the need for a spot treatment or hydrocolloid patch. 

My son had severe eczema as a baby and young toddler that is mostly under control now with CeraVe Hydrating and the CeraVe cream in the pump tub, but he still gets eczema in his elbow and knee creases. Snail healed those right up, so I put that on those places 3-4 times a week now and they stay clear when nothing else has ever worked for those spots -- and we have tried every freakin' lotion and potion under the sun for him.

My husband, on the other hand, cannot handle snail at all. He has some scars from welding along his jawline that have bothered him for years -- I mean bothered in the sense that they itch and are sensitive after he shaves, not bother him from a vanity standpoint. He's tried all kinds of Western scar fading creams and the like with no results. So I figured we'd slap a little snail on them and see if that could help. NOPE. He had huge whiteheads all along his jawline within 2 or 3 days of applying the snail goo, and he's one of those people who maybe had like 2 pimples when he was 16 and has perfect skin even though he does nothing with it other than wash his face and rub on a gentle lotion as an aftershave if he remembers to do it after he shaves. *a pox upon him, I swear!*
Actually, fresh Centella Asiatica is quite easy to come by in Malaysia. It's called 'pegaga' in Malay and you can find it sold in any market. However, pegaga that has been formulated into topical skincare products may be a bit harder to find, unless you don't mind using locally formulated products :)
It's not always the fault of the individual. Frankly, the state of medical care in the US is appalling - there's often t minimum a 2 week wait to see a dermatologist, if not 1-2 months. Reimbursement by insurers can be hit or miss, therapies can be expensive, and plenty of people (myself included) have experienced encounters with dermatologists who are only interested if you are there for expensive cosmetic  procedures. Sometimes, its desperation that leads people to Dr. Internet. But Google is a terrible medical school ;)
The only way spearmint tea works for hormonal acne is by ""messing with hormones."" Just because its a tea and a plant doesn't mean it doesn't contain active ingredients. ""Natural"" does not mean healthier or safer. It just so happens that a very low level of androgen blockade is necessary to improve most hormonal acne - you can supply this blockade by taking a medication where you can be sure of the dosage, potency, purity, and stability of the product, or you can take an unregulated supplement. I prefer prescribing and taking medications where safety is better established and where dosage is controlled, but that is my preference - I have a bias for evidence-based medicine. When it comes to recommending something to a patient, I rely on strength of evidence. When it comes to making a decision for oneself - well, that's another matter. The decision you make with your physician is yours alone. 

You can read a review of plant-based anti-androgen therapy [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693613/) 

And I completely agree that our healthcare system is garbage - it's a travesty that we cannot see the doctors we need when we need them. I'm sorry you had to wait that long while in pain.   
I'm on levo as well! Love my IUD, but my skin started freaking out about 2 months ago and will be getting my first curology shipment tomorrow. 

Have you seen any improvement using spearmint? I just recently started reading about it. I see my gyn for my annual next month and might look into it more since my facial hair is reaching new levels...
Yeah, there's a tendency to use it *instead of* sprinoloactone that I'm more puzzled by. I think the research on spearmint as an anti-androgen is interesting, but I also wish people would realize that just because it's ""tea"" doesn't mean its not an anti-androgen. I worry about people falling into a fallacy based on an [""appeal to nature""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature). 
I... yeah, I bought the Kose deep and broke out. Then bought Banila Co (the original one) and broke out about 10000000000x worse. I'm going to be healing the scarring for the next 2 years kind of bad. 

Buuuut now I know mineral oil is the culprit I guess.

I actually bought a decant of the Banila cleanser and used it for 2 weeks with no problems. It took until a month and a half in for my face to go nuts :/
[ANOTHER thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/41b75b/what_is_your_surprise_pimple_product/) that answers your question! 

OK, more editing of my post to do!
Lol, I'm so so sorry, I misread your question (Monday morning before caffeine!). So yeah, when people mention specific products over and over, they make it into each category. When people reference a brand or product line, it goes under the ""brand/product line"" category. For the most part, the Innisfree Green Tea *line* was oft mentioned, but I did not find specific threads as to what products individuals preferred. If there's a product you specifically like from that line, I'm happy to add it! Or I can see if I can find out if people prefer the essence, the serum, etc?
i wanted fresh one.  funny is when i asked pegaga, Malays couldn't tell me where to get it.
This is spot-on. I live in an area where there are only about 6 dermatologists within a 30 or 40 mile radius, and you have to wait forever to see one IF they are even taking new patients. Then you get there and all they want to talk about is spending thousands of dollars on cosmetic procedures. :/

Luckily, I have found one derm in the area who is very good. My son and I both see her, and she has never been pushy -- just addressed my concerns and gave me prescriptions as needed. I actually am going to undergo some pricey cosmetic procedures to get rid of my rolling acne scars, but she has never even mentioned it to me. I was the one to ask her about doing it.
I wasn't advocating natural vs pharmaceutical. I also don't think ""natural"" means safer. Please don't think I was advocating for ""natural"" supplements! I was just saying that spirolactane was never given to me as an option. I would absolutely take it but it takes so long to get an appointment with a derm that it can be frustrating. I'm going to try to get a derm appointment to get in person professional advice. 

Edit: added more explanation
I didn't see a difference with spearmint :( but I have read other people having great results. Definitely bring it up with your gyn and see what they think.
It doesn't really get much love here but the Shu Uemura Brightening Cleansing Oil (blue bottle) is absolute holy grail for my acne prone combo skin. Maybe it's worth getting a sample of? FYI I've broken out from other cleansing oils that Shu has on offer, so don't be deterred from trying it if you haven't reacted well to another one of their cleansing oils.


Wow, that really sucks :( I hope it heals okay. It's so disappointing when a common ingredient like mineral oil causes breakouts, especially when a lot of people use it without problems, and so it takes you unawares. YMMV is a pain! It's good that you've identified it, though.
YESSS THANK YOU~
That's so weird. These things literally grow like weed around my house. They'll sprout wherever it's even slightly damp. Then again, I do live in a pretty rural area. 
If not mistaken ""Pegaga"" is an ingredient one of the Malaysia famous Chinese herb drink at Perak name ""Â¥©Â§ßÁ¢ó "". So I think it's easily get at the market.

Well, that's strange, because pegaga is such a common herb here and you can find it virtually anywhere that sells vegetables. I have seen it sold at pasar tani as well as big grocery stores.
I'm so excited for you! I hope you share your progress here , though, if you'd rather maintain your privacy, of course... no pressure!

I'm thinking about doing a few posts on all the amazing things modern aesthetic dermatology has to offer. It doesn't replace our lovely, ritualistic self-care regimens, but I want to be sure that those of us with serious skin concerns realize we can probably SAVE money in the long run with a few strategic procedures with a dermatologist as opposed to spend years applying creams. 
Oh I know, I was just venting in general! It's awful - seeing a dermatologist is like trying to get tickets to the damn superbowl. It shouldn't be like this. And furthermore, you finally get an appointment, and the derm you see doesn't listen or doesn't take your concerns seriously (this of course doesn't describe all dermatologists, but its not an uncommon occurrence). So I totally get why, in the absence of options, people go with what they can access. I completely get it. 
Sorry it didn't work for you :(  I figure it can't hurt to try
I am living in rural area but this place is seawater so i don't see it. Send me some XD!  These are the best thing ever for acne.  Make sure no snakes has walk through it though else it is poisonous.
yeah but the place i am staying does have it because i have already been searching for it.
T_T  I am living near the sea so no such thing when it is easily available but there are many types of pegaga actually.
Exactly! And I will definitely document it here. I know there are a lot of younger people on this sub, and I think it would be helpful for them to see what's possible in the future when their financial situations are more secure and they have more money to spend. I know I thought my situation was hopeless in my 20s because I knew there was no way I could afford the kind of procedures I'd need to get rid of the scarring. 

I will always keep up my skincare routine because it HAS made a big difference for me, and it helps my mental health immensely to take that time for self-care doing something I enjoy, but you won't catch me buying $300 jars of cream because in the long run, there is only so much lotions and potions can do, ya know? 

I know some people probably think it's frivolous and/or ridiculous to spend money on cosmetic procedures, but for me, that's my vice. Some of us choose to drive fancy cars, some of us choose to accumulate an expensive handbag or shoe collection, or whatever -- I choose to spend the money on my skin. :)
Ohh, that might explain it! It's hard for anything to grow in saltwater. 

D'awwww. It won't be fresh by the time it gets to you. I didn't know they were so useful though. We'll need to stop treating it like weed. ><

Snake's are venomous btw, not poisonous. :) An easy way for me to remember poisonous vs venomous is: If you bite it and you die; it's poisonous. If it bites you and you die; it's venomous. 
Just want to jump in here and thank you for enlightening us on poisonous vs. venomous! :D I personally didn't realize there was a difference
weed??? Give me all the centella asiatica plants.  Well, it is herbs but not many people knows the benefits.

i said poisonous because anything that the snake slithered by is considered 'poisonous' in chinese.  I am not sure if i could use the plant become venomous???
I have read this discussion with an interest and  shall we say, an open mind. :)

I'm sure pegaga can be found in tropika. I don't have scientific journal to back up, but [this is close enough](https://books.google.com.my/books?id=sfgPl-IvduQC&lpg=PA76&ots=CvXk1Hmpr1&dq=daun%20pegaga&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false). Since it's in BM, tl;dr version would be it's easy to find, unless your house is IN the water. lol. I'm sure you're not like 100m to the sea. That would be dangerous and...dangerous.

I'm sure we all live in tropical region. There is no absolute way, one specific place is tundra or desert for no reason(s).

I can just say I can't get fresh ***Prunus mume*** if I were living in Japan, but people might disagree. 

Do you not have pasar malam (this varies from one neighbourhood to another) or pasar borong/basah? That would be as rural as a place can be. Asking an ahjumma for centella asiatica instead of pegaga/Â¥©Â§ßÁ¢ó, would only invite hard glare from them to me. haha

I've checked the ingredient in CosDNA, and I found there are many products that uses centella asiatica as its ingredients. Not sure if you have received sponsored/press samples related to it recently, but I am looking forward to read your* 'blog digest' containing that soon :)

"
Nivea Derma Skin Clear Deep Pore Cleanser,Dollar Tree favorites! (And not-so-favorites) w/ science backed ingredients,"I‚Äôve been shopping Dollar Tree beauty for the last couple years, but never had a place to post my finds! It‚Äôs great to finally have a community only dedicated to Dollar Tree beauty products. Hurray for the appreciation for these items! 

Here‚Äôs some old (may not be able to find) and newer products that I‚Äôve enjoyed and recommend. With some other products I‚Äôm less enthusiastic about but think some may still find useful for a short review. 

**For some background**: I‚Äôve followed the videos and content of dermatologist Dr Dray (who visits Dollar Tree saying what‚Äôs good‚Äîshe recommended the Kissable Foot Cream for instance). as well as watched a lot of skincare research videos by the two cosmetic chemists of [Chemist Confessions](https://youtube.com/@chemistconfessions?si=UOUzd8RbKlnA6VrE). Highly recommend their often very in-depth videos by the way (clinical research studies!). They are very fun and educational to watch! 

With this background in mind, I‚Äôve shopped Dollar Tree beauty with a mind on trying out interesting and effective ingredients on a budget. 

**Skin type:** Oily, acne prone, dehydrated. Some dryness during winter and with overuse of actives. 

##Miscellaneous health & beauty: 

_Medicine_
* **Valu Health Non-drowsy daytime cold & flu/nighttime cold & flu acetaminophen soft gels** - As good as DayQuil/NyQuil for fever and cold. Excellent for travel. Conveniently color coded orange (daytime) and green (nighttime). 

_Toothpaste_
* **Colgate Complete Protection Sensitive** - Pleasant mild mint perhaps similar to Sensodyne or Trident Spearmint gum. 5% potassium nitrate calmed my intense tooth aches before seeing dentist. In fact my dentist gave me just this toothpaste before. Tip: Use for two weeks before applying tooth whitening strips or gel to reduce sensitivity. 

_Deodorant:_
* **Suave deodorant energizing sport** - Has aluminum (chemically blocks sweat). Works for summer body odor. Masculine scent. Can leave white marks on dark clothes. 

##Body wash, shampoo, hand soap:

_Body wash_
* **Arm & Hammer Ultra Moisturizing Body Wash** - Best consistency of the Dollar Tree body washes I‚Äôve tried. Not runny; a regular gel. The unisex scents appeals to whole family but men especially. 
* **Power Stick Shower Gel Santal Woods** - Too runny. But nice smell. ‚ÄúSantal‚Äù means sandalwood but I also smelled cedarwood. Like Bath and Body Works Cedarwood Sauna perhaps. Unisex; appeals to men. 

_Shampoo_
* **Pro Silk Moisturizing Shampoo Moroccan Argan and Coconut Oil** - Too runny. Builds up over time. Will need a clarifying shampoo with it. Appreciate the extra large 32 oz value size. 
* I generally like V05 or Suave for clarifying shampoo if they come with sulfates. 

_Hand soap:_
* **Dermasil Extra Moisturizing Hand Wash** - Moisturizing and silky like Dove hand soap. A subtle cherry almond scent. 
* **Soft Soap Milk and Honey** - Moisturizing and gentle on hands. Pleasant, mild scent. 
* **Dial Moisturizing Hand Soap Vanilla Honey** - Similar to Soft Soap. Gentle on hands as promised. My dentist‚Äôs office uses a similar one. This is not antibacterial but antibacterial hand soap is not needed for most people and actually can lead to bacteria gaining resistance against cleaning agents. Pleasant, mild scent. 

##Body care 

_Body balms:_
* **Personal Care 100% Pure Petroleum Jelly** - Apply on minor cuts and bruises to help prevent scarring. Use occasionally in skincare for an extra occlusive layer (‚Äúslugging‚Äù). Daily overuse can make skin lazy though. Alternatively try Aquaphor, Cerave ointment or a face oil. Slight waxy smell. 
* **Xtra Care Revitalizing Body Balm Jelly Stick** - Very firm, drags. But is unscented and not the worst.
* **Kissable Diabetics‚Äô Dry Skin Treatment Foot Cream** - 1% Dimethicone (similar to La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm B5) and 30% petrolatum. More of a healing balm than a lotion. Stiff textured. But has effective strengths of active ingredients. Fragrance free. 

_Body lotion:_
* **Kissable Diabetics‚Äô Dry Skin Relief Lotion** - An excellent body lotion similar to Vaseline Intensive Care. A bit more fluid. Not as fluid as Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion but also more moisturizing. Simple ingredients (no ceramides), no irritants, fragrance free. 
* **Xtra Care Diabetics‚Äô Hydrating Lotiom Dry Skin Relief** - Similar to the above Kissable Diabetics‚Äô Dry Skin Relief Lotion. Simple ingredients, fragrance free, nice texture. Note: Was **recalled** once. 
* **Dermasil Eczema Relief Body Lotion** - Good consistency. Some soothing plant extracts and oat extract (but not to active ingredient levels). Has graveolens oil for fragrance. Imparts a sweet, herbal, earthy scent like chamomile. Liked ok. 

_Hand cream:_
* **Care All Creamy Petroleum Jelly** - 30% petrolatum. An excellent hand cream much thicker than Vaseline Intensive Care, great for dry winter hands. But does smell _intensely_ like baby powder. 30% petrolatum functions as a skin protectant similar to the 40% petrolatum in Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment. 
* **Udderly Smooth Hand Cream Original Formula** - The fastest absorbing hand cream I‚Äôve found! Impressed a nurse friend. Was developed to quickly moisturize chapped cow udders. 

##Face products 

_Face cleanser & cold cream:_
* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash** - Very good, non-stripping formula with gentle but effective cocamidopropyl betaine (coconut derived). Have used both day and night. Tea tree oil can have an anti-acne effect similar to benzoyl peroxide. Perhaps can leave on skin like a mask before washing off? Does not state percentage of ingredients so assume the salicylic acid is below 1%. 
* **B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream** - Dislike this formula and intense powdery scent. But does work surprisingly well as a cold cream cleansing balm to remove makeup. 

_Face lotion, eye cream:_
* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Eye Cream**, 0.5 oz - excellent silky smooth consistency like a more expensive serum. Has peptides but can‚Äôt say I noticed an effect. Squalane is the most non-comedogenic of oils 
* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream (jar)**, 1.7 oz - the same as the eye cream in consistency but more product! Similar ingredients such as peptides and squalane too. Topical collagen is not really helpful in skincare as the molecules are too large to reach the dermis, the deep layer of the skin. Better to use a retinol, vitamin C, or to drink a collagen supplement. 

_Face serum:_
* *^Skin Nutrition Botanicals Niacinamide 5% + Squalane Serum** - Truly excellent value! 5% niacinamide is quickly becoming the new industry standard for niacinamide as consumers learn that more does not equal better with this ingredient. 5% is the maximum recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic chemists these days, and even The Ordinary has followed suit. Niacinamide at this strength can help minimize large pores, strengthen skin barrier and help with hyperpigmentation as a supplementary active to a higher strength one and a chemical exfoliant (it takes a shotgun approach to deal with stubborn hyperpigmentation!). Most Skin Nutrition Botanicals serums are similar, but this one stands out because of its slightly cloudy, jelly texture due to the rice ferment filtrate and squalane. Reminds me of Korean skincare. 
* Have tried other Skincare Nutrition Botanicals serums such as the 1% vitamin C (ascorbyl glucoside; vitamin c derivative usually found between 2-5%, and up to 12%) and double retinol. Same gel serum consistency. Nice as serums. Not sure I noticed results. But others who have used them longer (especially the retinol) say they have. 

_Lips:_
* **Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips** - A made in Korea product, and does have a nicer feel. Thin, jelly texture similar to Nivea lip balm. Supposed to have a tint but is pretty much colorless. Love the scent: like a natural rose, but in a pleasant, non-perfumey way. Not as moisturizing as Aquaphor but not drying either. Also: the large pull off cap is amazing for slippery, just-applied-my-skincare hands. 
* I am interested in the lip spf products. Used to think spf 15 was too low but I heard that you want to apply lip SPF more frequently anyway since it wears off the most (eating, drinking, talking). I‚Äôll check out some more. 

##Limited products 

I have also tried and liked other Dollar Tree one-off products from better brands clearing out products such as ^^Lumin, Derma Geek, Ouidad Twist** hair conditioner, etc. My favorite is Lumin (face moisturizer in either oily or dry skin variants: citronnel scent similar to Belif moisturizer, and a similar Korean skincare feel like snail mucin infused product, except meadowsweet oil) and Derma Geek (gentle cleanser, night moisturizer with niacinamide).",https://i.redd.it/zhb4c3lhggue1.jpeg,"Have repurchased:

* The cold and flu capsules 
* Colgate sensitive toothpaste 
* Skin Nutrition Botanicals 5% niacinamide + squalane.
* Global Beauty Care collagen eye cream/skin cream. 

Would repurchase: 

* Pretty much all, except I‚Äôm always trying new products so I‚Äôm usually moving on to the next thing. 
* I‚Äôd get the deodorant since it‚Äôs travel size, but a different scent. 

Would not repurchase:

* B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream - I just don‚Äôt like the scent. Also the product was too fluid for the jar and leaked a bit when on its side. But, I think it does work as a cold cream cleaning balm in a pinch. 
* Pro Silk shampoo - maybe I‚Äôd get it again because of the value size. But it‚Äôs just not my favorite texture (runny). 
* Xtracare revitalizing body balm - didn‚Äôt really have a need for it. Thought I could use it for thigh chafing but I think it‚Äôs probably too stiff in texture to glide well. Didn‚Äôt try. 
* On this note I did try a gel stick again anyway, which I reviewed this week: [LA Splash Soothing and Cooling Stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/dollartreebeauty/s/yAX1l7nNnv). Yes it glides better but still drags compared to skipping on a regular serum. Works better with a toner for extra skip. I still feel like I don‚Äôt really need this product. And the fragrance makes it less versatile too.
Excellent review! I am a Dr Dray fan too (but I stopped following when her IG showed me stuff that was grossing me out. She‚Äôs a doctor so she can handle it. I am but a mere mortal scrolling while eating cereal). 

What do you mean by ‚Äúdaily use can make skin lazy‚Äù? For the generic Vaseline.
I really like the kissable diabetic lotion. I am not diabetic and don't know what the skin issues are specifically with diabetes, but I like the lotion. So of course I can't find it again in any Dollar Tree. üòÜ
Omg thank you so much for the comprehensive list! I'm just getting into skincare and this is so helpful!
Wow! Thank you for telling how these all worked for you or didn't work for you. This is a treasure trove of information. I appreciate your time and thoughts in posting this information.
This is excellent - thank you!
Thank you for such a comprehensive list!!!!!
So happy I found this post! I have really bag pih and I was wondering if any dollar tree products will be helpful :) Ty for the detailed info and review!!
B Pure Hydrating Gel Cream. I actually love it. My skin doesn‚Äôt get as oily in the T Zone as it does with other moisturizer. Plan to try it as a makeup remover tonight.
The smell of the cooling stick is terrible
>What do you mean by ‚Äúdaily use can make skin lazy‚Äù? For the generic Vaseline.

Common myth people believe
Yes I believe the Kissable Diabetics Lotion came maybe during the fall or winter of 2024 but was recalled earlier this year. I had already used mine up by that point and actually really enjoyed it. Thought it was like a more simplified version of Cerave! Not sure why it was recalled but haven‚Äôt seen it since. 

It was pretty similar to the Xtra Care Diabetics Hydrating Lotion of a similar name which I also liked and haven‚Äôt seen in a while. 

If you like this lotion I recommend Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair in the white bottle. It‚Äôs pretty affordable but Target‚Äôs Up and Up store brand makes an even cheaper and larger size version of it. Which I haven‚Äôt tried but YouTube dermatologist recommends as she‚Äôs a big fan of the advanced repair lotion. I‚Äôm not 100% sure if that one is still available though. Was called Up and Up Advanced Repair. 

Same one in this review: 
https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/target-up-and-up-advanced-repair-body-lotion-review-vs-vaseline/

I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs discontinued now. But it does look like Target is now selling a Cerave dupe which might be interesting. I think if you liked the dollar tree diabetics lotion you might like Cerave lotions in general.

Edit:

Here is an esthetician reviewing an Up and Up lotion they think is similar to a Cerave lotion. $4.50 for 20 oz is pretty good!

https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/s/w6QdKqMm8B
EDIT: I misspoke, it was the dermasil diabetic cream that I saw today!


It might be making it's way to your stores soon cause I just saw about 40 of them at mine today!
For sure! I definitely recommend checking out Chemist Confessions for educational content for skincare. They have a podcast too with the same content in audio form. 

I‚Äôll also recommend their book Skincare Decoded (which I got from the library). It is genuinely well thought out and organized for beginners and intermediate alike with many suggestions for routines. 

Dr Dray videos is great for dollar tree. Wish there was a compilation of them.
Yes please do try as makeup remover! Would like to know what you think. Does it work against long wear makeup? I think I tried it on some eyeliner pencils to success. Possibly also liquid lipstick. It‚Äôs been a while!

Ah ok I see it‚Äôs nice that you like it. Do you feel it dries down to a matte finish on you vs shiny?

I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs something people like about the neutrogena hydro boost moisturizer in the jar.
Give the Dermasil Labs Diabetic Lotion a try in Kissable‚Äôs place (I am still boycotting Target).
Thank you so much for the resources!!"

This is a refined list. The villains and fails were booted out a few weeks ago (examples - Minimalist Sepicalm, Pond's Super Light Gel, Mcaffeine Under Eye Cream, Plum Chamomile mask)

**Cleansers**

First cleansers and makeup removers

* *Plum E-Luminence Simply Supple Cleansing Balm* (10g mini, from Smytten) : Takes off makeup effectively. Waterproof eye makeup requires a bit more effort (and it kinda stings my eyes when I wash it off). Removes sunscreen well. WRP.
* *Garnier Skin Naturals Micellar Cleansing Water* (125 ml, MRP Rs.199, but purchased from Amazon for Rs.150) : With a couple of cotton pads and a little bit extra effort, it removes even waterproof makeup (probably because my oily skin has already broken it down nicely). Stings my eyes a bit. But does its job. WRP.
* *Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E* (200ml, MRP Rs.165, purchased from local supermarket) : Relatively inexpensive and effective oil cleanser. Doesn't emulsify with water. Pulls out sebaceous filaments so well. No adverse reaction (had a bad experience with pure almond oil). WRP.

Second and standalone cleansers

* *Bioderma Sebium Gel Moussant Purifying Cleansing Foaming Gel* (45 ml mini, from Smytten) : Love it, removes sunscreen by itself. Non-drying and skin feels very clean. I like using this during hormonal acne breakouts. I hear it hasn't been seen on Smytten trials for quite a while now. I got a full size in a care package, but I don't think I'll RP with my own money, too expensive (Rs.395/45 ml). I'd like to try the cheaper pink tube before deciding if I'll ever repurchase.
* *The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash* (250 ml, MRP Rs.745, from The Body Shop store in a mall) : I've been using this for ages, no complaints, except that it doesn't feel very comfortable to use when the barrier is compromised. Now that there are so many new cleansers I'd like to try, WNRP. Also, it lasts for sooo long, even with two people using it. A little bit goes a long way really.
* *Lever Ayush Anti Pimple Turmeric Face Wash* (150g, MRP Rs. 162) : Underrated af. Cleanses so well without drying my skin. Requires a slightly larger quantity to remove sunscreen. Works so well, sometimes I wonder why I bother with other cleansers. WRP. This is my favourite travel cleanser.
* *Ahaglow S Foaming Face Wash* (60ml, MRP Rs. 474 ) : I like using this on days I skip exfoliants. Nice clean feeling without it being too drying. WRP.

**Serums**

* *One Thing Centella Asiatica Extract* (150 ml, MRP Rs.1050, from Limese Connect) : Very thin, watery. No added fragrance, slight alcohol smell. I apply it to freshly cleansed skin. Sinks in quickly. So soothing and lovely. I've decanted about 20 ml of it into another serum bottle and I keep it refrigerated.  I used to look up cica / centella asiatica products and sob inwardly after looking at the price tag. Haha not anymore !! Soothes both fresh breakouts and ones in the post extraction healing stage. HG. WRP.
* *Minimalist 10% Niacinamide + Zinc Face Serum* (30 ml, MRP Rs. 599, from Be Minimalist website) : I used some code to get it for 15% off. This is my second bottle. Works better than the Derma Co niacinamide serum. No complaints, but my bf says it's irritating when applied to shaved skin. It goes well under sunscreen and makeup. I typically use it 3-4x a week, mostly in the AM. But whenever I use it in the PM, it is in combination with salicylic acid. WNRP tho (because I have purchased One Thing Niacinamide - review forthcoming !)
* *Minimalist Tranexamic 3% + HPA* (30 ml, MRP Rs. 649, from Foxy) : This is my second bottle. Foxy had a nice promotion going on so I got it for Rs.486. This works so well on acne scars and hyperpigmentation. There's a noticeable improvement after 2 months of consistent usage. I don't layer this with any other active. HG. WRP.
* *Paulas Choice-SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant* (30 ml, MRP Rs.900, from Amazon) : Watery, slightly oily finish. Sinks in, takes a minute. I use this 3-4x a week whenever I have acne breakouts (usually hormonal). I layer it over niacinamide serum sometimes. Acne dies more quickly and blackheads on my nose have reduced. I wish it was a dropper or pump bottle. Definitely better than minimalist's salicylic acid. WRP.
* *Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Serum +* ( 30ml, MRP Rs.1850, from Maccaron) : first, a disclaimer - this is my second bottle, both were gifted to me by friends. While I am quite fond of it, I will not repurchase it with my own money. This is my go-to lazy day serum, on days I really don't feel like doing any skincare. I just wash my face and put this on. It is somewhat hydrating, and gives me a nice glow. Takes some time to sink in fully. Nothing extraordinary. This is the first Vitamin C product I've used (the actual percentage of Vitamin C in this is not very clear). WNRP.
* *PULP Day After Binge Superfood Day Serum 20% Vitamin C  with Ferulic Acid* (30ml, MRP Rs.1095, from Pulp website) : I got it for Rs.600ish from the website, some sort of Diwali sale. It has LAA. I was scared of nuking my barrier, so I mix it with moisturiser before applying. I never experienced any tingling, not even while patch testing on multiple spots. I've used it about a dozen times now and I love it so far. Glowy, even a little bit plump. Might be HG, considering I haven't purged (yet ?) and skin looks quite nice. WRP ( I wish my repurchase window coincides with a nice sale hehe) .

**Acne patches**

* *COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch (24 patches, thick) and COSRX Clear Fit Master Patch (18 patches,thin)* (from Maccaron and Beautybarn, MRP Rs.280) : Honestly, I don't feel there's a difference between the two, performance wise. The thiiner one is better suited for wearing makeup, otherwise the choice is based on the size of the pimple. Has never disappointed. WRP. HG.
* *The Face Shop Dr.Belmeur Clarifying Spot Patch Kit* (Rs. 790, The Face Shop Website) : I got it on a BOGO offer, will RP only if there's a similar offer. The kit consists of two kinds of patches - a hydrocolloid patch pack like COSRX, which works just as well, and a plaster patch pack, which is a thin, plasticky non-absorbent cover meant to be used after using the hydrocolloid patch. It is supposed to be soothing, but it just slid around my face before falling off.

**Under Eye products**

* *Garnier Skin Naturals Light Complete Eye Roll On* (MRP Rs. 189) : I keep it refrigerated. I use it 3-4x throughout the day. Works beautifully. Depuffs, and cools the skin. I've noticed that it also kinda lightens my dark circles, but I've been using it for years now. I've been using this for years now and beats every other under eye product I've ever used. No oily feeling, watery, sinks in a minute or two. HG, WRP.
* *Kaya Hydro Replenish Under Eye Cream* (I think they've stopped producing this, haven't seen this anywhere for a while now) : Simple, no frills eye under cream, gel like consistency. Sinks in well. I'd RP, but can't find it anywhere now.

**Clay Masks and Pore Strip**

* *Himalaya Herbals Oil Clear Mud Pack* (100g, MRP Rs. 135) : Simple, effective. I've been using this for years. Doesn't dry my skin out too much. WRP.
* *Eunyul Clean & Fresh Intensive Hydrating Clay Mask Pouch Pack - Skin Refining and Clarifying* and *Eunyul Clean & Fresh Pure Brightening Clay Mask Pouch Pack - Nourishing and Glow Boosting* : disclaimer - I got it in a care package, not sure where it was purchased from and how much it costs. Honestly, I couldn't tell them both apart, similar performance. Used both before wedding related events. Skin felt brighter and softer compared to the Himalaya clay mask, but I'm guessing this is several times as expensive. Ah well, a nice little treat, like a sheet mask, except I got three uses out of each pouch.
* *Miniso Deep Cleansing Pore Strip* : I know pore strips aren't very kind to the skin, but using this once every 2-3 months has worked out very well for me. These Miniso ones are MUCH better and gentler than the HipHop brand ones. HG, WRP.

**Moisturizers**

* *Physiogel Hypoallergenic Calming Relief A.I. Lotion* (100ml, MRP Rs. 476) : Best moisturizer I have used so far. No adverse reactions. Feels calming, hydrates and moisturises. Sinks in, takes around 2 minutes. Slightly greasy after a few hours, but nothing blotting paper can't fix. HG, WRP.
* *Disguise Cosmetics CC Sorbet Lotion* (50ml, Rs.400) : Its nice, light but refreshing fragrance. No adverse reactions. Sinks in well, not too greasy later. WNRP because it is overpriced for what it does. Will buy only if there's a really good discount.

**Pre Suncreen and Sunscreens**

* *Kaya Youth Skin Relief Pre Mask Face Gel* (50g, MRP Rs.499) : disclaimer - I got it in a care package, but I will RP if it goes on discount. I apply it after all the serums have sunk in, and follow it up with a sunscreen after a few minutes. Noticeably helped reduce maskne. I feel it is a bit overpriced though. Strongly fragranced for some reason.
* *Reequil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA ++++ UVA* (50g, MRP Rs. 695) : I've only purchased it while it is on discount. On my second tube. HG, WRP. Don't feel like experimenting. Works like a primer for my makeup, so that's convenient. No pilling, blends well, not much of a whitecast (i'm somewhat wheatish toned).
* *Lacto Calamine Daily Sunshield Matte Look Sunscreen SPF 50 PA +++* (50g, MRP Rs.349) : I like this, I use it on my neck and arms. Not too bad on the face, but requires a good amount of blending and leaves mild pinkish tint that goes away in a while. WRP. Great for the price.
* *NIVEA Sun Lotion, SPF 50, with UVA & UVB Protection, Water Resistant Sunscreen* (75ml, MRP Rs. 360) : I take this along with me on outdoor sport / hiking / beach trip days. Awful white cast, pills, but it is relatively cheaper so I simply wipe off with micellar water and reapply as needed without feeling too guilty.

**Lips, Oil, and Sealing**

* *The Body Shop Hemp Heavy-Duty Lip Care* (MRP Rs. 395) : Despite having multiple tubes of this, I couldn't find even one to photograph. I will cry if they discontinue this, ngl. Great under makeup, great by itself. HG, WRP. Lips feel nice and plump in the morning and it keeps liquid lipsticks from drying out my lips.
* *Disguise Cosmetics Rainbow Glow Oil* (30 ml, MRP Rs.700) : I used to love it, but now I'm ambivalent towards it (mostly because it's hard to finish up before it starts yellowing and losing its efficacy). Super light, sinks in well. I use it with and without moisturiser. Didn't clog pores. Will RP if it is on sale.
* *Vaseline Original Pure Skin Jelly* (21g, MRP Rs.42) : Why is this fragranced ? Why ? But it is nice, does the sealing well. No clogging of pores. Just nice soft skin in the morning.

This is one awesome post! Kudos! ‚≠ê‚ú®
OMG, 70% of our routines are almost same!! I loveeeeed your mini reviews‚ù§Ô∏è. Also about the hemp lipbalm, I‚Äôve been using it for last 4-5 months too and I wanted ask, does it smell a lil different some time after the application? It has been performing great for me, hydration and plumpness wise BUT it smells a lil TOOOO WEIRDISH after like an hour. If I drink water from a glass, the rim of the glass smells like it too. The smell Is somewhat fishy?!
I'm intrigued by the ayush face wash. And I'm definitely getting the pulp serum. And the body shop lip balm. 

Ugh shouldn't have read this. Too tempting.


And disguise rainbow is yellowing? Is that normal? Why are oils changing colour?
One Thing Niacinamide is too tempting!!! Waiting for the review!
I am also thinking of trying that pulp serum for so long we'll definitely give it a try next year...hehe....nice review...i also love reequil sunscreen....

Hey about the physiogel lotion...is it enough for damaged barrier?
Hey, curious to know what went wrong with the Ponds Super light gel?
Great reviews. What care package are you talking about?
Omg, I use body shop tea tree face wash (my HG for summer season), bioderma face wash(also HG)
I used to think is it me only who can't finish body shop tea tree face wash within 8-9 months...it's been 5yrs..I am using this combo..even I feel it's bit too much (quantity wise) and need a change but I am sceptical to change the routine...so I am sticking with it as of now..

Also thanks for reviewing centella, I am eyeing for it üëÄ

I cannot find Garnier roll on anywhere. where'd you buy it?
Is TBS hemp lip balm fragrance free?? I have reallyy sensitive and chapped lips, looking for a heavy duty lip balm
Hey OP, silly doubt. I read that you store your One Thing Extract in the refrigerator. Is it okay to store it in the refrigerator with the carton ??
Hey OP , I think unfortunately Nivea has discontinued spf 50 moisturizer , it is no more available in stores not even in malls.(I desperately checked all of the stores last month )
Some Amazon sellers still have it but I doubt if its genuine , could be old stock.

Could you check and confirm ?
Please reply if possible
Hey op can you drop your routine?
Is lacto calamine sunscreen water-resistant?
I loved the lever ayush face wash. Can't find it anywhere now
It definitely lightens them. For particularly bad ones, I start applying it as a spot treatment once a day as soon as the wound heals, and it lightens considerably within 2 months. It takes more time to lighten older scars, in my experience.
Heheh, thank u ü§≠ please post and review your stash babies !!!!
I've never noticed any change in smell after application ü§î do check the expiry date, I've had some other TBS hand creams and balms smell a little strange once it's a couple of months past expiry
Also, how's the Pulp serum working out for you ?
About the Disguise oil, I checked with the brand and sent pictures when I first noticed it. This was their response  ""The Rainbow Glow Oil is designed to be used within 6 months from opening (you'll see this on the box as well). As it's probably nearing the end of this period, that's why you are starting to notice these changes in the product. It's safe to use but may not be as efficacious. We'd recommend finishing it as soon as possible and moving on to a new one. üåà""
hehehe these are my faves ! The ayush face wash has remained the same since I was in class 12. I must have bought atleast a dozen tubes since then. Love the pulp serum, the push and twist bottle cap is annoying tho, doesn't close in a satisfying way. The hemp lip balm is why no other lip balm can entice me üòå‚ú®
A couple of months ago, I damaged my barrier. Physiogel lotion and minimalist's niacinamide were the only two things I used on my face and it helped !! Barrier repair might be faster if you include cica and/or hyaluronic acid as well (assuming HA works for you ).
It was okay at first, but whenever I used it after a strong active, it would feel uncomfortable, a sort of burning sensation. Using it up on my arms and legs now :(
A gift basket of sorts from my friends. It had some skincare stuff, makeup, and snacks. It was sent to me while I was on a work assignment in a remote place !
the Centella is absolutely worth it !!
Oh I usually buy it from a supermarket near my house. I also remember buying it from Nykaa pre-COVID.
It does have linalool, limonene and geraniol so it's not fragrance free ig . The Neutrogena lipbalm is fragrance free and it's not bad at all
You can, but the carton will become soggy in a while. I've just kept the main bottle and the decant together in a tray now.

I have conflicting opinion on Pulp Vit C serum. You can check one of my earlier post for a detailed review but as of now, I had stopped all Vit c products from my routine, and I‚Äôve been having good skin days ever since. Being someone with oily and acne prone skin, I feel Vit C doesn‚Äôt do much for me. Although, I have half of the bottle left and I have recently started reusing it since last week (alternate days). Since it‚Äôs quite potent, I can‚Äôt use it everyday without my skin tingling and burning a lil. Anyway, so far, I cannot tell you how much has this particular serum has been responsible for the glow. I have been using other actives too- AHA BHA Peel and Tranexamic Acid in my routine. All of these combined have given me overall great texture and a good amount of glow after 6 months of consistent use. I hope that answers your questionsüòÅ

[here‚Äôs the link to my earlier post reviewing the serum](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/opyg61/here_are_my_views_in_comments_on_these_infamous/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Can you update the status of pulp vitc's oxidation when you're done with the bottle, please?
I liked the hemp one too but it has funny smell. But i love vitamin E one from body shop. Any way, Its a great review by the way
Hmmm sounds good but i have very very dry skin which is also acne prone....and i get red rashes also
Ah okay. 
I'd recommend you use it straight after cleansing, wait for 10 min, and then use your actives. It'll act as a protective hydrating layer. Anyway, thanks for replying and such a detailed post! :)

That's so sweet of your friends. I thought you were talking about a subscription box.
üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Oh yeah! It would get soggy. Also, the Eunyul clay mask retails for ‚Çπ100 on kindlife & is mostly on discount at ‚Çπ80
Sorry to bother you , I know its available on Nykaa and Amazon but I have read various reviews on Amazon claiming it to be a fake product , thats why I prefer purchasing popular brands like Nivea offline after cross verification.
But this time its not available in any local stores or malls they say it has been discontinued and according to them the ones available online might either be old stock or fake product.
What do you think ? Please share your views.
If you write to the brand, pls let us know what they say !
OMG I remember this review ü•∫ !! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è it's so detailed, this review is why right from the beginning I've been applying only after mixing with moisturizer and being as cautious as possible ‚ú® you're right, we do have v similar routines ü§≠
Yes ! I was thinking of keeping track of it on a monthly basis, I'll try to take pictures to track the extent of oxidation. I couldn't find any reviews mentioning it's tendency to oxidise ü§î
Thank u ü•∫
True, I've not smelled any beauty product with a similar fragrance. Maybe other stuff in the hemp range, idk ü§î I love the vit e too !!
Oh I'm not sure if Physiogel lotion will be moisturising enough as it is quite light. 
Bioderma Baume / cream has been reviewed well on this sub for barrier repair, and dry skin.
I'll try that out, thank you !!
I don't think that's the case because sometimes I skip moisturizer (and go straight to sunscreen in the AM) and I've not experienced that sensation. This is the only moisturizer that has made my skin react like this
Oh I had no idea about this, I'll write to Nivea once I'm finished with my current bottle. It's a shame if they've really discontinued it :( imo Lacto Calamine sunscreen is often BOGO or similarly good discount so if this one is discontinued I'll replace it with Lacto only, I'd say it's comparable in terms of comfort, not too sure about sun protection but I've never tanned wearing it
Okayy
I‚Äôve had the pulp vit c bottle for like 5 months now and it still hasn‚Äôt oxidised on the other hand my minimalist vit c shows signs of oxidation after 5 months.
Yes even i am thinking of trying them only thing is i have to stretch my budget a little too much to get it but i think it is the only safe option left...

Write to Nivea ? Do you mean send an E-mail available at their website?
Thanks , lemme try Lacto then.üòä‚úå
Another question , have you observed that ""pure skin jelly"" and ""skin protection jelly"" are two different things ? 
While you have mentioned ""pure skin jelly"" the container in the image mentions ""skin protection jelly""

is it just the same thing with a change in label ?
And have you observed Vaseline has changed ingredients and labeling several times as well. It has removed ""petroleum"" from its labels.
Just asking cause a close friend suggested me to use lip care with Petrolatum or petroleum based products.
Do keep an eye on Boddess and Foxy, I've seen Bioderma products for 30-50% on both those sites !
I am hearing these sites name first time in my lifeüòÖü§£"

I‚Äôve tried it, and honestly, it‚Äôs a solid go-to if your skin leans dry, sensitive, or just needs a break. It feels super gentle and hydrating ‚Äî more like a light lotion than a typical cleanser ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt leave that tight, stripped feeling after rinsing. I didn‚Äôt get any irritation or breakouts, though I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs better as a morning cleanser.
yepp, i am using this for a while now , cetaphil is a trusted brand and this cleanser is great , removes dirt from your face and it feels very hydrating
Super gentle and hydrating, no breakouts for me. Barely any scent‚Äîgreat for sensitive skin!
I've been using it for a long time and my skin has become so radiant. Best decision of my life.
Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser is genuinely gentle, non-stripping, lightly hydrating, and fragrance-free. Great for sensitive skin‚Äîno breakouts, just clean, soft skin. Definitely worth trying!
Its great, after using it your skin feels very hydrating and it gently exfoliate your skin without making the skin dry
Sounds interesting! I've been on the lookout for a new cleanser, especially one that doesn't strip the skin. If anyone's tried this, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how it performed. My skin can be a bit finicky, so curious about breakouts or irritation.
Idk about others but I got the mini version, I use it whenever my skin break out and it's so good!!!!!  I have combination skin.
Good yet overpriced
Moisturiser is bad but face cleanser is great
Better alternative: moiz cleanser
For dry skin yes it is definitely worth it
It's a must have moisturizer , if you have extremely dry skin. My skin recovered so fast because of it. Even cleansers are not harsh on the skin."
Cetaphil hydrating foaming cream cleanser,Cetaphil Foaming Cleanser gave me h*lla lot of pimples!,"F23 I have oily, acne prone skin.

Said product that broke me out. Cetaphil Hydrating foaming cream cleanser

I started my new skincare journey a month ago. I've always just used cleanser since it's hard to pin down what works for my skin. So far, the cleanser that worked for me and improved my face was Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (old formula). Then, I switched to CosRX daily gentle cleanser, but I went back again to Cetaphil (bar version). All of them worked for me, but I found CosRX to sting a little around my nose area, so I went back to Cetaphil.

Around last two months, I bought **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser in its huge bottle (900 PHP or so), only to learn it would make me break out so bad.

In the first two weeks, I used the **Cetaphil Hydrating Foaming Cream Cleanser with Biore UV kids sunscreen + Luxe Organix Cica gel as moisturizer. I thought the sunscreen was the cause of my breakout. I tested another two weeks for cleanser and moisturizer combination, then cut off sunscreen from the routine, only to find fungal acne on my forehead, gradually progressing to pimples on all other places of my face.

I was still hesitant to drop my Cetaphil because I bought a huge bottle and thought it would work as other Cetaphil versions did for me, so I stopped my moisturizer for another week. But lo and behold, the pimples keep popping out every single day, on my cheeks and neck, and they hurt so bad. I thought I had a problem with my teeth nerve roots or something because it kinda feels like gum ache at this point, lol.

After staying with a cleanser only for around three days, my face start to look unhealthy, oily, and my pores were much noticeable prolly cos of the lack of moisturiser. My face was nowhere perfect before but it didnt get this bad since i started using cleanser 2 years ago. It doesn't have its usual glow and looks similar to how I look when I don't wash my face with anything when I run out of my cleanser. And the f pimples constellating on my face just hurts so bad!

After this one and a half month ish battle, I traveled away from home and I didn't bring my cleanser, so I stayed without it for about three days, and pimples were still relentless in reminding me how I would be looking ugly.

Then, I picked up Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser new formula in its smallest bottle, praying ten times before I took it from the shelf. This cleanser has a creamy translucent texture that feels much more gentle than the foaming one. It only took a matter of two days to make the pimples stop, and my face starts feeling better. I do have so much pimple marks to deal with now tho.

***I included*** [before and after photos.](https://imgur.com/a/I7AkGbW) ***im not sure if you can see much of the difference, but anw, hope that helps.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1cmtzbd/cetaphil_foaming_cleanser_gave_me_hlla_lot_of/,"Skincare is always a YMMV thing. If there‚Äôs one thing I learned, dermatologists end up cheaper than trying cult favorites or online recos. If I took everything I spent, mas mura and mabilis derma + isotretinoin + lasers. And with longer- lasting effects too. 

That said if a product causes irritation. Stop immediately and focus on not irritating your skin and keeping it hydrated to lessen scarring. What works for others won‚Äôt necessarily work for you talaga. Cetaphil was not good for me too. Neither was niacinamide. Nor SK II. Iba iba talaga.
Shit akala ko ako lang. 1 month of using and hindi ko pa inaamin sa sarili ko kasi ang mahal but I know something's not working with this formula. I noticed ang dami ko nang bumpy whiteheads like all over my face na dati concentrated lang sa nose area ko. Now it looks like an allergic reaction na and ang bumpy na nang face ko.

Minsan the more products we use, the more it damages our skin. Kaya ako wala na at all nilalagay sa mukha, tumigil din pimples ko. Nyahaha i use hada labo cleanser panhilamos tapos wala na at all.
Hi OP, I‚Äôve been using this for years (oily face din) but didn‚Äôt encounter this. I know iba-iba naman tayo, pero which one exactly yung binili mo? Because the one I buy comes in one size lang and costs php450. Exact name is Cetaphil Gentle Foaming Cleanser.
I prefer Cetaphil cleanser from SnR compared sa Cetaphil cleanser sa Watsons. 

Iba din kasi amoy.
I'm using neutrogena acne foaming cleanser low ph lang siya after using it for 1 month no more breakouts.
When I‚Äôm testing a new product, I buy the small one or kung may sachet mas okay para test ko muna kung hiyang ng skin ko. Similar product, yung cetaphil nila na cleanser dati hiyang ko yun ngayon hindi na. ü•πü•≤
What works for me ay celeteque or neutrogena. So far di naman ako nagbrebreakout, nag-ooily masyado, or magda-dry ang skin. Hyaloo naman na moisturizer ginagamit, light lang kasi sa skin pero hydrating.
If you're oily and acne prone try using actives like a Salicylic acid cleanser or toner. It helps in penetrating your oil glands and dissolving deep seated dead skin cells, oils and other debris that is causing acne. There are a lot of gentle cleansers with actives available in the market.
I swear, what happened to Cetaphil? I last used cetaphil way back 2019. It was prescribed by my dermatologist as my face and body wash since I had extremely sensitive and dry skin back then. It's reallyyy expensive, but it worked in hydrating my skin back then.

I haven't used it since then since I already found a much better cleanser for a fraction of its price (COSRX Good Morning Gel Cleanser), but may nabalitaan ako na nagreformulate sila, thus the stinging and the break outs üò≠
If you‚Äôre only looking for mild cleanser, try Baby Flo Soap Free bath. It sounds weird, but trust me, it does the work. I‚Äôm on Epiduo Forte and I don‚Äôt get any bad reaction using that cleanser.
better option is dove baby sensitive wash
Personally, I think mas harsh talaga yung other cleansers na hindi gentle skin cleansing. I usually use the gentle cleanser kasi dun umayos skin ko, pero may times na I need to use my sister‚Äôs daily cleanser/hydrating cleanser kasi di ko nadala yung akin. And I feel so squeaky dry (not in a good way) pag ginagamit ko yon compared to my usual. IMHO better stick with the gentle cleanser; di siya harsh sa skin and leaves your face feeling moisturized kahit kakahilamos mo lang.
I also bought this bottle recently and fortunately have not experienced any breakouts yet. I have combination and very sensitive skin, which is why I switched to this product because my usual skincare routine suddenly started causing allergic reactions after trying retinol for a week. üòî  The reason I bought this product was because of the bottle description that says it removes oil and makeup. Lol.

It seems the hydrating cleanser may be formulated for dry to normal, sensitive skin, which may cause breakouts for those with oily skin. I noticed that the bottle says ""All skin types"", but their marketing image says ""Dry to Normal, Sensitive Skin "". üòî 

Thank you for sharing your experience with this cleanser. I may consider switching to the gentle foaming cleanser as I have an oily T-zone.
Same tayo OP! Akala ko dahil nagpupurge lang ako pero nag stop na ako for 3 weeks sa adap tapos yan yung facial wash ko. Sobrang laki ng breakouts ko at puro bumpy whiteheads üò≠üò≠üò≠

Gaslighted ko pa sarili ko huhu kaya nung 5.5 umorder na ako ng ibang cleanser ü•π akala ko ako lang nakakaranas üò≠
[removed]
Also used a Cetaphil product, specifically Moisturizing Lotion for face and body, and I also had breakouts. Nanghinayang ako kasi ang mahal. I was wondering if shunga lang ako kasi ginamit ko sa mukha, but the packaging said its for the face too. It was super itchy! Ayun, naging pimples na nga and now scars. T.T
It must be the formula. You said you have oily skin, tapos gumamit ka ng cetaphil hydrating, which can make your skin more oily kaya nag clogged pores mo. Mas suitable ang cleanser with salisylic sa oily type skin since SA can desolve oil buildup. I have super oily skin too btw.
by any chance, is anyone here using the gentle facial cleanser na for oily skin? 'yung tag 900+ na maliit. i badly want to try it kung worth the price naman. i'm oily skin and acne prone, i'm currently using their regular gentle facial cleanser from cetaphil din eh.
Hello its happening to me too! 3 days of using but face feels tight and nararamdaman ko na puro sya tiny bumps tas namumula ako and parang sunog. Mygod. Its cetaphil it should have been gentle. Sayang purchase huhu
Microneedling can help with acne scars. Yun nag work sa akin
Hi, that‚Äôs what happened to me with a cetaphil moisturizer too, so I never used it again!! I switched to cerave moisturizer, and I‚Äôve been using it for months. I combo it along with the Neutrogena foaming cleanser, and I didn‚Äôt break out ever again! I‚Äôd only get 1-2 pimple only during my hormonal stage (or whenever my whiteheads would act up lol)
this happened to me too! i use the gentle skin cleanser and hiyang ako, but my mom wanted to repurchase it sana but accidentally bought the foaming cleanser once. sabi niya same lang naman yun. when i tried it, i broke out A LOT. i was so sad and my insecurities came back. okay naman na uli once na bumalik sa gentle skin cleanser
Yes, I‚Äôve literally never struggled with acne like we‚Äôre talking maybe got three pimples at most at the same time but once I started using the new cream, foaming cleanser instead of the normal gentle skin one my face absolutely hated it and now I have so many scars on my face and it‚Äôs gonna be very expensive to fix it. Best advice is to not get this cleanser.üòÇüôè
im glad im not the only one experiencing this! bought this cos its cetaphil üò≠ but sadly they reformulated! so far vanicream and pyungkang kul acne facial wash works for me :) i prefer hydrating ones kesa may actives for facial wash!
Hi! I use this cleanser (but only at night, morning i use just water to cleanse my face) and it works for me. Used to use the gentle version but eversince i started using sunscreen i feel like its not enough to remove everything off my face
Effect ng Cetaphil brands (gentle skin cleanser) sa skin ko hindi maganda. Pati yung exfoliating cleanser nila ganito din effect. I'm dry skin:

After 3 days of use, 2x a day. I think better siya for oily skin.

üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è I have recently come to this conclusion as well. My most recent skincare purchase was Anessa sunscreen pero hindi hiyang. Parang isang Co2 session na din yung total purchase ko the past 3 months trying out different skincare brands. I'll just purchase sunscreen from my derma clinic and invest in derma procedures.
daming biktima ng foaming cleanser na to ha!
I added more to my routine din kasi cos i am exposed to sunlight all day. And my face idnt reslly in its best shape.
Oh right. Sorry for the confusion. It was the hydrating foaming cream cleanser which i thought was the bigger version of your said cleanser.
Hi! Is this the 236mL one? 'Yung liquidy loob?
I wonder why. Baka from different country ung nasa snr compared to watsons?
Kahit safeguard bar soaps magkaiba amoy hehe
May i ask what moisturiser u used with it?
ung may 0.5% salicylic acid po ba?
Masyado taga ako nag apura thinking cetaphil cleansers r all equal. Sorry aken ü•≤
I see. I used cica gel kasi and it feels like prang film na naka coat sa skin. Di talaga naabsorb. So pag nilagyan ng sunscreen over it. Nag pi peel.
+1 sa celeteque.
+1 for Celeteque and Hyaloo!
anong color ng hyaloo moisturizer ginagamit mo?
anong specific product name po ung neutrogena one?
Takot ako sa may salicylic ü•π
Oh its for bsbies din kasi so ig its really gentle
I like this one for its gentleness but if your preference is something na may bula kahit konti lang, then this is not for you huhu.
Lesson learned!
Glad it helps!
As a dry skin person, hindi maganda effect sakin ng Gentle Skin Cleanser, masyado pa rin nakaka dry. I got white flakes and red rashes even if I used serum and moisturizer. Posted pic in this thread [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/s/jpePU7hlnK)

OK siya kung morning-only na cleanser or once a day, pero pag morning + night mas lalo nakaka dry ng skin.
In denial rin talaga ako for weeks. Blaming less expensive products as the cause of my pimples ü§£
Yeah. I went back ti gentle cleanser din. Woosh.
super oily ng face ko nung ginamit ko yan
I was planning to buy that kasi goods daw sa oily pero guess not üò≠
Cetaphil cleanser is good pero yung moisturizing lotion nila for face and body ay hindi. Nag break out din ako dun and mas nag oily face ko. Parang mas nabblock nya ata pores ko causing more pimps to pop out.
Yeah i think this product isnt just made for me. I am still wary of using cleansers with salicylic tho as it might be too stripping. But perhaps i can use it alternate sa gentle cleanser? Last time kasi i got more pimples lang since i frequently used cleanser with SA
update: i bought it na and nag-breakout ako ü•≤
hays move on na T-T balik ako sa cetaphil gentle cleanser, working naman as intended
Is this prescribed by a dermatologist? Sa akin kasi laser na agad ang nirerecommend nila. Ano ba ang mas malala sa dalawa?
Is this a procedure?
Oi maresearch nga. Gusto ko rin sana hydrating kasi iba pala talaga effect sa mukha pag well moisturised ang skin!  Also. I notice your username eyyyyy. Or im overthinking??
Hello! Hindi po ba naglleave ng parang residue/film yung vanicream after i-rinse off?? Currenly using cetaphil foaming cleanser and planning to switch because of this reason.
mannnn
count me in. maybe i'll have to empty the bottle to buy another one. mahal pa naman hahay i thought it's normal baka nag aadjust pa yung skin ko.
Ingat sa dagdag sa routine kasi worst skin ko yung ang dami kong nilalagay.
Oh ok, thanks! I see it na nga sa lazada. That sucks ang mahal pa naman ng cetaphil
https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.mCgny
Yep. Magkaibang countries sila made. 
Not sure sa performance kung same pero (baka psychologically lang) feeling ko mas gentle yung US made.
sorry i don't use moisturizers. cleansers will do the thing na I'm M btw. dito ko lang din nabasa sa r/beautytalkph about neutrogena. for me eto talaga ung facial wash for us na have oily and acne prone.
Yes yun nga.
Gumagamit din ako ng cica gel pero sa gabi lang. Pag morning, toner, Hyaloo, vit c serum, tapos cosrx na sunscreen ginagamit ko. Dati di ako gumagamit ng toner at moisturizer sa morning kaya parang nagpe-peel din skin ko pero ever since I incorporated toner and moisturizer okay na texture ng face ko with makeup. Right now, trying to find a good primer naman ako.
Yung Deep Clean Acne Foaming Cleanser
Why? You can start with the lowest percentage of like 1% salicylic acid cleansers if you want to try. Cleansers are washed off so it has a very short contact time in your skin. 

I suggest you watch [Jan Angelo's Best Face Wash for Oily + Acne Prone Skin](https://youtu.be/o4vUXvAVOzU?si=Am4RPm7sAb5ZdZ9d)
To add, 600ml of Baby Flo only costs 200php or less. It lasts me 3 months.
Hi OP! I have a dermatologist who recommended Cetaphil for me (back in 2019) pero lumipat ako ng Celeteque kasi mas affordable sya and it also works wonders. Okay din naman daw yung gamit ko, ayon sa derma ko, so tinuloy ko na rin sya. Maybe you can try the Celeteque hydrating cleanser (yung Blue) for a change baka gumana din sayo. üòä 

I use this along my niacinamide serum, retinols and celeteque moisturizer.
muntik ko pa bilhin kasi nag 50% off sale
try Dove Sensitive Hair to Toe
did you stop using it? ano na pinalit mo? Im using it now too kasi nag 50% sale nga sila and I dont know if im breaking out ba kasi may mga pimples na ako before using it :(
I think laser, kasi di naman ganun kadami acne scars ko. Plus ito lang afford ko
Yes po
hiii no residue naman!
Noted. Im actually more minimalist in approach din
Also makes sense now kasi cream based pala sya. Kaya parang clogging rin siguro. Idk. Speculating.
Thanks for this! I've been eyeing this product also
Thats interesting. Tho wala kaming snr. Might check sa online shop nila if ever.
Oh i see. Glad one product works for u! Ill check that out
May i ask alin tong cosrx sunscreen?
Thanks for the resource! I see ur a fan of osamu dazai work too!
Thanks for the info!!!
Yes, i never used it again ü•≤ I went back to the their gentle skin cleanser na lang. I just tried it since I have oily skin, hoping na ma-lessen sana. Hngkkk.

I suggest siguro you check if may bago ba na pimps or if lumala 'yung acnes mo.
Oo nga po eh. Medyo mabigat sa bulsa yung laser and ilang balikan pa kaya di ko rin matuloy tuloy treatment ko. Thank you po sa pagsagot üòä
Vitamin E Vitalizing Sunscreen
[deleted]
Bale sa Slimmers face and body ako nagpapafacial and reboost (microneedling). Yan din nirecommend ng consultant nila. Plus kapag nag slae slimmers world, like 30% or 50% dun lang ako nag aavail.

Cetaphil hydrating foaming cream cleanser,Skincare and Grooming tips for Indian Teenage Boys (from a 19 y/o who‚Äôs been there),"**Why Skincare Matters (Especially in India)**

If you think skincare is unimportant, you‚Äôre wrong. Every man you idolize online ‚Äî actors, influencers, athletes ‚Äî all do some form of skincare (and even makeup sometimes). It‚Äôs not ‚Äúgirly‚Äù or ‚Äúsigma‚Äù or whatever cringe label people throw around. It‚Äôs just hygiene and self-care.

Why is skincare extra important for Indian guys?
	‚Ä¢	Weather: Sweaty summers, dry winters, crazy humidity ‚Äî our skin suffers.
	‚Ä¢	Pollution: Indian cities = dust, dirt, and pollution constantly clogging your pores.
	‚Ä¢	Genetics: Indian skin is more prone to acne scars, pigmentation, and tanning.
	‚Ä¢	Sun Exposure: UV index here is brutal. Skipping sunscreen will make you look like an old leather bag at 30.

TL;DR ‚Äî Take care of your skin now or regret it later.



**Skincare Routine for Beginners**

**Before we start**: Identify Your Skin Type & Concern

First things first ‚Äî figure out:
	‚Ä¢	Skin Type: Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal?
	‚Ä¢	Main Concerns: Acne? Dull skin? Pigmentation? Uneven tone?

**Golden Rule:** Always buy products based on your skin type and concerns ‚Äî not random Instagram trends.
If possible, visit a dermatologist once to get a proper analysis.

**Daily Routine**

**Step 1: Cleanser (AM/PM)**
	‚Ä¢	Wash face with a gentle cleanser (like CeraVe).
	PM Tip: If you use sunscreen (which you should), double cleanse at night ‚Äî
	1.	First, wipe face with micellar water (like Bioderma).
	2.	Then, cleanse with face wash.
	‚Ä¢	On extra sweaty/dirty days, I swap my PM cleanser with a Salicylic Acid Cleanser (like Minimalist).

**Step 2: Toner (Optional, AM)**
	‚Ä¢	After cleansing, pat face dry with a clean face towel.
	‚Ä¢	Use toner only if needed ‚Äî for dry skin, I use TONYMOLY Ceramide Mochi Toner. Most people can skip this.

**Step 3: Targeted Serums (AM/PM)**

Serums = Targeted treatment for specific concerns. Choose based on your needs:
	‚Ä¢	Hydration: Hyaluronic Acid
	‚Ä¢	Brightening: Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Kojic Acid
	‚Ä¢	Exfoliation (2x a week): Glycolic Acid
	‚Ä¢	Acne Treatment: Salicylic Acid, Tea Tree Oil

What I use:
	‚Ä¢	AM: Vitamin C (daily)
	‚Ä¢	PM: Salicylic Acid (3x/week) & Glycolic Acid (2x/week)

**Step 4: Moisturizer (AM/PM)**
	‚Ä¢	After serum, always moisturize.
	‚Ä¢	I use:
	‚Ä¢	Cetaphil DAM (for normal to dry skin)
	‚Ä¢	Bioderma Atoderm Cr√®me Ultra (heavy-duty)

**Step 5: Sunscreen (AM only ‚Äî non-negotiable)**
	‚Ä¢	For dry/normal skin: Cream-based sunscreen
	‚Ä¢	For oily/combination skin: Gel-based sunscreen
	‚Ä¢	Minimum: SPF 50 + PA+++

I use UV Doux Gel Sunscreen ‚Äî works well, non-sticky.
Avoid influencer hype brands. Stick to reliable drugstore options.


**Haircare Routine**


**Step 1: Shampoo**
	‚Ä¢	Frequency depends on sweat/dirt. Generally, 2x a week works.
	‚Ä¢	Use sulfate & paraben-free shampoo.
	‚Ä¢	Personally, for my thick, wavy hair, only L‚ÄôOr√©al Professional Range shampoos make my scalp feel truly clean.

**Step 2: Conditioner**
	‚Ä¢	Every time you shampoo, follow it up with conditioner.

**Step 3: Leave-in Conditioner / Hair Serum**
	‚Ä¢	Not mandatory, but if you have dry hair, it‚Äôs a game-changer.

**Step 4: Hair Mask (Optional)**
	‚Ä¢	For very dry/damaged hair, use a mask once a week.



**Grooming Essentials**

**Lip Care**
	‚Ä¢	AM: Apply Nivea Original Care lip balm.
	‚Ä¢	PM: Use plain old Vaseline or Boroline before bed.

**Shaving (for clean-shaven guys)**
	‚Ä¢	Use a good razor ‚Äî  I use the Gillette Fusion 5 Power.
	‚Ä¢	Shaving foam? Try Gillette Charcoal Foam (cooling effect is elite).
	‚Ä¢	After shave, apply an after shave lotion followed by a moisturizer.

**Beard Care (for my beard bros)**
	‚Ä¢	Get a good quality Philips Trimmer (adjustable heads are clutch for styling).

**Body Grooming**
	‚Ä¢	Get a ceramic blade trimmer for body hair.
	‚Ä¢	Also, invest in a nose/ear trimmer (trust me ‚Äî game changer).

**Extra Hygiene Tips**

Deo/Roll-on
	‚Ä¢	My picks: Nivea Maxx Fresh or Rexona Men or Chemist at Play 5% AHA (for dark pits)

Oral Hygiene
	‚Ä¢	Floss before brushing. Brush for 2 mins. Use a tongue cleaner. Follow up with a mouthwash.

Smelling Good
	‚Ä¢	Mix a few drops of Plum body oil into your body lotion.
	‚Ä¢	Or invest in a good perfume (r/DesiFragranceAddicts has great recos).

**Final Advice**

Skincare & grooming aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcringe‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre basic self-respect.
Take care of yourself and you‚Äôll naturally feel more confident. Whether you‚Äôre trying to impress your crush, glow up for college, or just feel good in your own skin - you may even end up getting the baddie tooüòâ

Need product recos? You can head over to r/IndianSkincareAddicts .

**I know my personal routine might seem expensive for a lot of teenagers, and trust me, I get it. But I‚Äôve chosen to invest in myself because I see it as a long-term investment in my confidence and appearance. That being said, you absolutely don‚Äôt need to spend this much to build a solid routine. There are plenty of budget-friendly products that work just as well, especially if you focus on the basics ‚Äî cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Skincare doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank.**",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j06riq,"We now have a daily thread at 9pm IST to discuss any topics you would like Join our [INSTA](https://instagram.com/rteenindia) [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/qczCszNanW)

High effort post üôå, will get them when I'll have money ü§ë![img](emote|t5_5kzsg2|57057)
the minimalist cleanser is literally goated
I agree that skin care is important, but this shi is too much lmao. Nit everyone has this much money, nor give enough Fuks abt their appearance to regularly spend this much money time and effort to rub creams on their face, so they can ‚Äúlook good‚Äù in their 40‚Äôs and 50s. Use like face wash against oily skin and then moisturiser to make sure it‚Äôs not too dry. thats basically enough for an average guy, unless u have some skin problems
Also sulphates and parabens, are not as bad as u think they are

Sulphates are surfactants (basically, cleansing agents) and they can be a little harsh, but once a month or so I'd suggest ke sulphate wala hi shampoo use Karo. So that u get all the dirt and product build up out.

Parabens are preservatives, and honestly? They're the safest ones out there. They're the oldest, most studied and don't cause a lot of allergies.

Other preservatives cause a lot of allergies. Don't demonize these ingredients, that's all a marketing gimmick to make u buy ""cleaner, natural and safer, chemical free"" stuff. Don't fall for that.

Hey I currently have been using the minimalist oat extract cleanser for my dry skin followed by plum niacinamide and rice water toner and dot and ket barrier repair moisturizer and the wishcare sunscreen. I am thinking of investing in a serum and better toner ( thinking of the wonder one mentioned in your post heard a lot about it) I would really appreciate some suggestions ( skin type is dry flaky skin and uneven skintone)
I've. Beenn only using, fw, exfoliator once a week, and sunscreen, went from having mild cyctic acne and dark spotted face to, less acne but still spotted face.  But yea skin care is imp.
Is the loreal absolute repair range worth it? Esp the hair mask

Isn't toner unnecessary?

Jitna laa diya ahi wahi use karunga
i only use cetaphil face wash (cleanser) and cetaphil ka hi lotion (4th pic)
i love how the basic assumption is my household finances bhai woh 1st slide he kuch 2000 k aas paas ki hai
Agar mere or itne paise hote toh ,mein skin care kyun karta ü§í
Bro this is too much
Though i do all this besides hair care,
(I will soon do that as well)
You forgot to point out these stuff cost a lot!
,Like buying 4-5 stuff would surely cost 1500-2000 especially from brands like Cetaphil and minimalist etc,
Though for a guy who is just starting it should be like face wash moisturizer and sunscreen 
Or just save the pocket money given
areyy thank bhai
very expensive
Too much, for those who want a minimalistic skincare routine :


Cleanser - salicylic acid + niacinamide¬†


Suncreen - niacinamide + vitamins + hyaluronic acid


Lip balm - spf 50 + vitamin e / kojic acid¬†


Bodywash - Kojic acid / lactic acid


Smell good ? - Perfumes / ittar ( budget friendly )¬†


Hairs - mild shampoo
As someone who has really dry skin, Cetaphil moisturizer and face wash gets the job done. Also got a good deal on a Philips all in one hair trimmer for 4k(absolute value).
paisa kon dega?
Mummy papa be like : ""paani, take it or leave it""

thanks man, truly appreciate the hair product. ihave thick wavy hair myself and facing dryness
Drink water and water and water only
Instead of wasting self research time, visit a skin doctor and get proper skin treatment.
You should definitely try Anua double cleanse, it's absolutely amazing and a game changer
Bhai itna paise nahi he üò≠ yeh sab kharidne keliye na time he
Kya purre din creams hi lagate rehneka?
Bhai money theek hai but itna time kon invest karegaüíÄ (coming from someone who actually does ""skincare""), I jus use foxtale waala facewash that shid is goated, and sunscreen after facewash fixes half the stuff. And keeping your hair clean is legit the key in my experience. Anyways good post tho, happy to see someone actually giving a shit about skincare and not just yapping about mewing and ""old money asstheticü´É"" and actually giving useful advice. Very coolü´µüëç
Rin ka dabba! That's it
Guys if you are broke ek cleanser and ek sunscreen (SPF 50 and broadspectrum) yeh use karo chehera glow karega pura...
Bhai mai toh mooh dhul loon nahane wale sabun se wahi bahut haiüòÖüòÖ
Just have clean food and drink lots of water. Thats the best skincare.
Can we use salicylic acid and glycolic acid alternatively?
And which one is better for removing tanning?
Baad me padhunga abhi mnn nhi itna padhne k

Don't use cerave bec of their ingredients . A gentle cleanser will work for you!
I just do cleanser and moisturizer with sunscreen. And sometimes face serum if i have more active acne. I‚Äôve been doing this for more than a year and my skin got just a little better but still it‚Äôs not as good as others üò≠
Apart from serums and stuff I do everything you have mentioned I am surprised that this isn't normal for every guy.
If anyone finds this too expensive then you can do what I follow : For face I just use sunscreen 50 spf and boroline night cream . For hair I use bare anatomy shampoo ( you can choose whatever problem you are facing with your hair ) and conditioner can be of any brand. For beard I use trimmer for shaving every 2-3 days , and a razor like once a month or when I have to go somewhere. For arm pits just use any roll on , you wouldn't know if you are smelling or not but others around you do. So use for their sake at least.
Sabun üíÄ
Genz ‚Äòs are rich 
ü•≤
ye itna samman meri mummy bhi nahi lagati
I use the same razor  (I don't even have a normal beard or mustache) and roll on but I think its a little excessive
Wow . Meanwhile me born with good genetics only needs to wash my face with water (not mandatory) . Ig tho op does make sense tho my looks will decline if I don't  atleast take decent care
Bhai paise yaha momos ke nahi rehte aur tum skin care krne bolre ho
Bhai isko thoda saral bhasa me likh do ghanta kuch samjh nahi aa raha hai
im 17 and never shaved i only trim my beard to zero. Is it okay to just trim all my life or would you reccomend to start shaving at one point anytime soon
You forgot to mention that working out regularly and eating a decent amount of protein are a must before anything else. No matter what you do, if your diet ain't fixed, then acne would return anyway. So, fixing diet, hitting the gym regularly, and using cleanser and sunscreen according to your skin type will set you apart from 99% of the people
Itne product me se aaj tak keval 2 use kiya h razor aur vaseline aur dono face se jyada kahi aur use hota h
how is the nivea original care lip balm, my lips are always chapped and dry. I have been using minimalist's lip balm for 3 months but no positive results üòîüëéüèª![img](emote|t5_5kzsg2|57040)
I didn't read all these things- BUT THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS!! 


LITERALLY. Most of the men that I know don't even care about skincare/self grooming. They think that it's a feminine thing to do. My aunt advised my cousin to do something for his skin and he thinks that it's a very 'feminine' thing to do/doesn't even cares. What's worse is that my mother advised him to wear a deodorant atleast but he didn't listen to that. Like seriously, no one needs a lot of skincare to use like op posted here. You're grooming yourself for your outer impression.
mere pas bas ek lux ka soap hai
Bhai Surf Excel aur Gulf Engine Oil hain. 
Chalega ki nahi bol de

Bro I am just lazy ,It's not sigma or anything.
I think just washing my face with face wash and then applying something is enough

Almost all the things op mentioned are the basics, are people in the comments okay?
Just take vit-c tablet and vit-e in liquid capsule. Chand rupay m miljayega pharmacist se. Ek fashwash aur moisture for face and lip k liye 5-10 rupay wali vaseline jelly ki dbbi (choti hoti hai pr sirf lips p lagayega to 5-6 mahine aram se chl jati hai).
Ek sunscreen pe hi lagega Paisa depends on how much you use it. Drink a lot of water. I think now you should be fine. 
Agr dak circles hai to uski koi cream dermatologist se recommend krwa lena

Baki sab to theek hai but paise kaha se lau.



(jokes aside just go for face wash, moisturiser and sunscren and all set)
I ain‚Äôt reading all that.
Cetaphil is quite costly affordable nahi hai mere liye currently
Thanks OP for thia detailed skincare routine. Trust me, i was looking for something like this to build up my skin care routine. I might just follow up everything which you said in the post. 

I was already using sunscreen and cleansing my face at night followed by a brightening serum and a moisturiser. Hope i can add more to this routine and get to know my confident self soon enough.üí™
Itne pese nhi h ( or itne sare products kon lagaye itna alsi insaan hu me ) (2-3 saal baad pese kamauga fir karege )
Nice skin care routine bro.
Bro how much does it cost you every month? 
And can you please tell me how long each product lasts?
any suggestion for sunscreen and moisturizer for oily skin, ive been using cetaphil moisturizer but its too damn greasy and i use Dr Rasheel sunscreen which is okay-ish

Use 1 blade razor like gillette guard or 2 blades razor gillette vector plus or de razors. Fusion with 4/5 blades is bullshit irritates the skin
The audacity to call all that shit basic . This is HARDCORE CAPITALISM . I hab been doin half this shit for  2 years now and it's a burden to follow each day . All am waiting for is to empty the bottles I already have to stop this once and for all . Sunscreen is a need , moisturizer is a need , cleanser ? Yeaahhh...a need , anything else that costs heck lot money: absolutely not . Stop this dependence , let your skin take care of itself ....it's programmed to do so .

That‚Äôs perfectly alright, not everyone needs a targeted serum or toner.
Ughhh. Not be that girl, but snail mucin extracts snails in a v cruel way and keeps them in unhygienic condition as well. Its not an ethical/Moral Brand.
Yes, I use it on days I get extra sweaty or on days I engage in some sport
read his last paragraph brother
Yeah. I think the classic and necessary skincare  products are a good Cleanser and a Sunscreen. Moisturizer IF it is winter or your skin gets extremely dry. Else everything is optional and can be used for people with any specific skin problems. The current trend of overconsumption and putting products on our face just because capitalistic corporations say so is extremely harmful. 

We should be very mindful about the ingredients and products we put on our skin and try to swap as many products as we can for homemade/natural/healthy alternatives. Plus regulating your sleep, diet, exercise in itself is excellent skincare.**The goal shouldn't be perfect skin, it should be healthy skin.**

Good for OP tho, you do you!
Perfectly said!
but sunscreen is really important brother and there are some good sunscreen at low cost too
Sunscreen and lip balm are also mandatory
Yes ik, that‚Äôs the reason I use a chemical based shampoo. But some shampoos with sulphates like clinic plus etc, often dry your scalp. Hence I mentioned sulphate and paraben free products. For anyone who‚Äôs not very into skincare.

My point exactly
You don‚Äôt need to if you have no concerns.
Use sunscreen daily ... Others based on your concern/needs
I know, i haven‚Äôt used it much. And it truly does not protect my skin, I use it on my hands as of now.
500 rs mein sab basic miljayega
I mean it‚Äôs a pursuit - once you get into it, there‚Äôs no turning back.
It depends, my t-zone is oily but my cheeks feel dry, hence the combination of products. My main concern is always on hydration and acne though.

Means you‚Äôre doing it right.
It‚Äôs good. Everyone‚Äôs skin reacts to the same product differently. For me personally, minimalist suits me quite well.
I have it for a few months now and it's really good
Will post on r/IndianSkincareAddicts, will post a follow up here as well.
A good quality moisturizer should suffice. For dryness, Cetaphil DAM has been my holygrail for years
My skincare products costs me 8k to 8.5k approx and lasts for a good 2-2.5 months. Some products last longer than the other. Based on usage. 
My haircare costs me 3.5k. Since I wash my hair quite often they last 2 months. May last longer for fewer usage.
Other essentials (body lotions, mouth washes, roll on, oils etc) are bought monthly and cost about 2k. 

An average monthly overall expenditure would be 8k roughly.
Search on YouTube for better understanding.
For me as a Delhites, I think, I‚Äôd look roasted if I went out without some spf
For AM - Good cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen
PM - Same Cleanser and Same moisturizer
They‚Äôre absolutely necessary, your skincare cannot borne fruits for you until you exercise, drink a lot of water, and follow a clean diet.
Itne bhi paise nahi hai bhai, sadly.
I replied the same on a different comment. If I were to talk about my average monthly expenditure on self care (skincare + haircare + bodycare) it would be around 8k. But I don‚Äôt spend exactly this every month. It‚Äôs just based on the sum of all the products cost / how long they last. Although you can very well make a good routine under budget.
Favourite
Agreed. No amount of skincare will work without cutting out junk, abundant water intake, good amount of sleep and exercise.
But I don't do this much ...I personally used  face scrub and moisturizer and if needed sunscreen.

For hair shampoo and depending upon my hair length conditioner that's it .

And I sometimes use soap on my whole body too if I'm running late üòÇ
Personally for me, my expenditure can vary between 5k to 8k on an average monthly basis.
üò≠üò≠
Man for the love of god don‚Äôt use bellavita, i‚Äôve only heard bad reviews about it.
Yes, for most, but personally for me, my skin tends to get very dry, even after using a moisturizer, hence the moisturizing toner
Aloevera gives me acne breakouts bhai
Everyone‚Äôs skin is different. I tried that aloevera wali bakchodi once, man gave me a bad acne breakout. My skin doesn‚Äôt response well to homemade things and these gharelu nuskhas
Very cost effective perhaps, only if I was so blessed.
Wallet clear?
My parents have always given importance to skincare, so there‚Äôs that.
If it works, it‚Äôs all you need.
Isn‚Äôt it the oppositeüò≠
Yes, the basics are Cleanser - Mosturizer - Sunscreen, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve mentioned everything else as concern focused or optional.
Nine-Teen
Replied the same on a different comment, explaining a detailed breakdown. But on an average 5k to 8k/month. Don‚Äôt confuse this for money spent in a month.

Yes, i use salicylic acid 3x a week and glycolic acid only twice on days, i‚Äôm not using my salicylic acid. As for tanning, glycolic acid works.
Yess. Always use them on alternate days only. Also, for removing hyperpigmentation, use kojic acid. Either serum or face wash Works, along with vit C and sunscreen Application

As in the environment or the pocket?

Omg sigma skibidi in the chat

I replied the full breakdown on a different comment. But on an average basis around 5k-8k p.m. for everything. Includes Skincare/Haircare and bodycare products. Don‚Äôt confuse this for monthly cost. This is just based on an average.
For moisturizer you can go for any gel based moisturizer. I‚Äôve used Instree Aqua Gel Cream when my skin felt oily, you can also check out the Sebamed Clear Gel Moisturizer. As for sunscreen, UV Doux has been my holy grail. I‚Äôll recommend the same to you. Alternatively you can also go for Re‚Äôequil Ultra Matte Dry Touch.
Sure
Mar jaaunga par ye chutiya desi nuskhe nahi use kar paaunga. Ye to sattu se protein wali baat kardi. Gut health is important, agreeing to that, but you would still need a basic skincare routine to maintain it.
No, I‚Äôve personally never used a milk based toner. As for the one I use rn, it has been a game changer for me. Provides enough hydration to support the rest of the skincare.

This has nothing to do with your looks, your skin health makes you attractive imo
It‚Äôs not for smell, it‚Äôs an anti perspirant, it stops your underarms from sweating, hence avoiding body odor.
You don‚Äôt need to spend as much as I do, I do it cause I can. You can still use a cleanser - moisturiser - sunscreen. All under 500 to 600 rupees.
Waiting
Use a Kozicare Soap Bar
Baaki ki zarurat bhi nahi hai, if you don‚Äôt have any specific skin concern.
Tab to tu desh ke bahar matt jaana kabhi
Glycolic acid is not to be used daily. It‚Äôs an exfoliating agent, you don‚Äôt need to exfoliate your skin everyday, use can start using it 1x a week and then increase frequency over the subsequent weeks of usage. As for a cleanser, with glycolic acid, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using it everyday. You can use it on alternative days
It is enough. That was the whole point of the post to lay out a basic skincare routine. Toner and serums are optional.
Good ol‚Äô listerine or hexidrin
That worked for you bro, might not work for everyone, sabki skin different hoti hai, my gut health is good, but I still used to get acne due to growth hormones, i tried natural methods like aloe vera and all, but it just made it worse for me. Personally my skin responds better to chemical. Moreover everything I apply on my skin is approved by my dermat.
Everyone is there to make money bhai, do you actually think this patel guy is a social worker or sum, hell nah, even he‚Äôs minting money out of y‚Äôall. I‚Äôd rather trust myself with a certified someone, who is an expert in what I‚Äôm visiting them for.
Jokes on you there were no advices, just a skeleton for a skincare routine. Only if people knew how to read.
No worries bhai, it‚Äôs all just genetics, maybe you‚Äôre a late bloomer
Did my part.
Some things like moisturizer, sunscreens, roll ons etc need to be bought every month, while serums and toners can last 3-months.
Whatever works for you man, you can‚Äôt speak for everyone, that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve mentioned serums/toners etc as optional. If you have acne, sorry but no moisturiser or cleanser is gonna cut it, you‚Äôll have to use a serum focused for that. Every product has a use case. As for capitalism, I get where you‚Äôre coming from, this is a lot to follow, and quite expensive too. But this is absolutely what works for me. To each their own ig.
Acne prone skin might require additional products, he did mention the serums and toners as optional.
Agreed to disagree, a clean diet, proper water intake and good sleep is just as important as a good skincare routine. But whatever works.
Perhaps we have some sigma skibidi boys in the chat afterall

Definitely more than enough, but please abroad matt jaana.

Yeah the shampoos aren't supposed to be too stripping. I'd still say ke once a month ya once every 2 months, sulphates wale shampoos are fine.

Also many shampoos often have sulphates but aren't that stripping because of other ingredients in them. So we can't say exactly that sulphates make a shampoo stripping or too harsh. 

And paraben free is just a marketing gimmick. 

Nice to see a guy actually pay attention to skin care though. A lot of my own male friends are like ""this is all for gays or chhakkke, not men""

Ik you think it works for you right now but acne and a lot of stuff that just appears on your face mirrors the inside o your body . It'll show up just as bad once you stop using all of the stuff . And that's what most companies and influencers won't tell you . Eating the right stuff and active lifestyle is what'll help in the long run .
i don't hate you bro you're doing good for yourself but more than helping the masses you're just blatantly belittling a MASSIVE chunk of us middle class students who are finding it difficult to meet ends and moreover those influencers and some girls who manipulate the young ones that this overpriced minimalist etc product is very important for you otherwise you're missing out on this and that like you could've shared the effective and cheaper alternatives to your personal products for the masses that you're serving here

Ok
I don‚Äôt know about every brand, but I thought Minimalist, Cetaphil, and CeraVe have good products
if they care so much about their skin why won't they care about their body tho? i mean there probably are some people like the one u said but if theyre so concerned over their appearance, why would they care only for their skin? wouldn't they also invest in hygiene products?

Lol true, I‚Äôve stopped purchasing any of my products from Indian skincare/cosmetic brand, except for Minimalist.

Yes, I‚Äôve been loyal to Minimalist specially for their serums
You have to be a superhuman to survive delhi ki dhup without getting tanned
Cannot recommend what I have not used. You can head over to r/IndianSkincareAddicts to figure out a more personalised routine
My personal recos would be re‚Äôequil ultra ultra matte sunscreen or the UV Doux gel sunscreen or the Minimalist SPF 50 fluid sunscreen
My derm said just the opposite, my skin has always been sensitive to weather changes, uv etc. Mostly due to the cautious environment i‚Äôve grown in. My skincare is verified by my dermat, I use everything only after running them by her first. So irrespective of what I feel. I have to use these for keeping my skin healthy.
That‚Äôs good bro
Good that you‚Äôre in quarantine.
I‚Äôd trust my doc, over a random youtuber. Thanks for the suggestion though.
Sorry to burst your bubble, searched this Oscar Patel on reddit found this, he‚Äôs a [scammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/orthotropics/s/JVxbF7Rmch) . This is the reason you should trust a doc.
I use a very heavy sunscreen. Double Cleansing is necessary to remove the sunscreen, a gentle cleanser wouldn‚Äôt work. And not removing your sunscreen can result in clogged pores.
Not true at all, was facing a lot of tanning, used AHA BHA peels. Tan was removed, never once used a peel after that, just basic vit c and sunscreen.
I get it bruv, but no where did I mention to use exactly what I‚Äôm using. I just laid out a skeleton, anyone can use products that are much more affordable. I used my routine as an example for the same.
Yes, irrespective of how dense your beard is, you can always use a trimmer. I use one too. But personally I prefer that razor clean look.

Himalaya face wash costs 80rs, moisturizers choti dibbi costs under 50, lip balm 10rs. This is basic and mandatory skincare, you don't need serum and alldat. Hafte main ek do baar rice mask banake laga lo bas

Minimalist and Plum for me. Minimalist is goated but its sunscreen doesn't suit me at all. While Plum has Great selection of sunscreen and vitamin C, and body mist obvio

Things that he said in his videos is not any bro science but things that are actually true and already approved by science.don't know about his paid looxmaxxing course though but his YouTube healthmaxxing videos are genuine no bullshit üêÇüí©.

Idk man a dermat told me that double cleansing is not necessary unless you‚Äôre wearing makeup
I appreciate your efforts towards Normalisation of BASIC skin care and hygiene in our country and it's important but Moreover all that toner and serum and types of many unnecessary products which are just LUXURIES and far from basic necessities but those being Normalised as an agenda by these fear Mongering big brands and influencers is what I'm concerned about üôèüèª i appreciate your efforts all the way just 1 request is that try to share alternatives that 90% of your Audience where you're posting can atleast try  üôèüèª for example instead of the COSTLIEST Gillette fusion majority can easily try Gillette Presto/Gillette guard üëçüèª which costs only 10 rupees

Bhai theek hai lekin yeh do baar kyu nahaya tune mtlb do baar msg kiyaa
Ditto
Arey sister that I have, extra things like serums and toners are a hassle. As mentioned by op in another comment, it takes him about 8500 rupees per month to maintain his self. Not everyone is that rich.


Apologies for my previous message, I will revoke my downvote
Dekho bas facewash and moisturizer and sunscreen is the basic 
Sunscreen is also important kyuki bohut dhoop hoti hai
Facewash kyuki dhool mitti saaf karne ke liye and bhai even facewash mai normal soap bhi(haath done wala nahi) woh bhi chalta hai , it was always basic hygiene bas india mai nahi maanta woh alag baat hai
Since.. Forever?
Washing your face thrice a day + applying sunscreen and moisturizer on skin + lip balm on lips are considered one of the most basic hygiene and almost everyone does it/should do it.

Serums, toners and using an oil based facewash (before using your normal facewash) are not basic but these also make a world's difference
*sister
 also wtff its giving chronic paan eater ü•πü•π
hmm
You deserve better

It was salicylic acid derma or something idk blue bottel , love beauty hairfall shampoo is literally the best for my scalp I will repeat it again¬†
I use biotique facewash ( idk it suits my skin ) - Nivea moisturizer and boro plus .
I mean is your hair wavy, curly, straight. Are they dry and frizzy? Or what?
Yes, I too didn‚Äôt like Minimalist‚Äôs sunscreens. And Plum also has great selection of body oils too. Love their Hawaiian rumba and Vanilla Vibes range.
Minimalist sunscreen doesnt provide proper protection as well and dot and key has good face washes imo

Mine too, skin never felt so hydrated.
Your dermat clearly doesn‚Äôt know that silicon based heavy sunscreen can clog pores if not double cleansedüòì
Yes, I had already planned out what you mentioned. I just need a bit of research. Will come up with a post for an affordable - essential skincare routine.
mummy kasam maine ek hi baar bheja tha![img](emote|t5_5kzsg2|57040)![img](emote|t5_5kzsg2|57040)
I don't use toners as well. But u just gotta find a loophole. 

If u are dealing with acne, u gotta use salicylic acid right? So buy a facewash that has salicylic acid in it. 

Instead of micellar water, use rose water. 

If u really wanna invest in something, buy a Vitamin C serum only. Apply 3 times a week only 2 drops. You'll have amazingggg glow. 

Skin care is easy bro. Its not as hard as they make it seem. Just chill and know your ingredients and needs
Bhai then say it's basic skincare rather than ""hygiene"" bcoz hygiene have many meanings not just face .
And true i was saying bout the product that are in photos of the post , a basic moisturizer and sunscreen will do it, but should not make it too much complex
Sis ive seen ppl that REEEK LIKE A FISH MARKET and they be the most beautiful ppl I encounter, it‚Äôs all abt what they choose to take care of. Ok skin and ok hair and ok hygiene is WAY better than great skin are great hair care and bad hygiene right?

Ik, I used to go to classes at 12 PM while wearing minimalist, and godddd, I used to feel like im melting. Only ik How I survived to empty that bottle lolüòÇ
Ig it differs according to skin. Minimalist provided me good protection, but it was just UNBEARABLE. For face washes, im thoroughly Dependent on derma co lol.

I see! What does the vitamin c serum do btw. What is its main function and how expensive is it?
![img](emote|t5_5kzsg2|57042)sorry yeah hygiene mai tab bhi aata hai , and abt the post ,yeah it is just expensive stuff , mere pe facewash bhi itta sasta hai, but yeah there is a thing called as face hygiene 

skincare mai bas thoda alag cheez add hojati hai , but still it is basic hygiene , likhna bhool gaya tha lmao
I'm using dot n key for sunscreen can you recommend me a affordable good cleanser.
Isn't derma's serum too expensive like it lasted 25 days only for me or was I overusing it???
well, on r/IndianSkincareAddicts someone had tested sunscreens efficacy on their legs by sitting under the sun and minimalist didnt provide proper protection but yeah use what suits u the best
I‚Äôll mention everything I‚Äôve personally used and worked for me :
Re‚Äôequil Ultra Matte Dry Touch , UV Doux Gel Sunscreen, La Roche Posay uvmune (expensive but worth it)
OP has suggested Great sunscreen recs to u. But if u are Looking for something more in budget, then I'll suggest De construct, or Plum 2‚ÑÖ niacinamide rice water. 

Imo tho, requil is still the best
It makes your skin bright. Like reduces dark Spots, pigmentation, etc. It might also make it more supple. It has a glycerine like texture, so one drop for each cheek is enough. 

Since u are a Beginner, obvio start with lower concentration. They are usually under 300. But they'll last for a long while. 

I personally don't use them regularly tho. To save money, start using them when some imp event/festival is coming up lol
I get it brother what you are trying to say , but skin reflect gut health and eating right stuff and drinking 3 litre of water everyday will do everything for most people if not all and washing face with aloevera will remove dirt , I'm telling form personal experience
dot and key sunscreen is good. what is your skin type? dry/oily?
idk about the serum i use cleanser of derma coüò≠ ykw i have been using different apps to compare price of the products, from nykaa to myntra. Two months back, I bought 2 packs of Earth Rhythm for rs.468 while MRP for one is originally 589, and that too from Myntra. So i think before buying u should compare once
Ohkk. Im not gonna go back to it tho, never. SS that im using rn is so much better. It was the First sunscreen I used, maybe thats why I have this notion lol
I see! Thanks a lot!¬†
But sunscreen , good moisturizing according to weather (More in winters/dry skin) , nails trimming, regular hair cut, applying conditioner or hair mask after washing hair with shampoo once a week (or more if needed) , having a bath daily, applying lip balm are all included in daily basic hygiene
In summers it's combination. 

Rest seasons mostly oily but in summers it becomes lil dry
I toh used zepto free cash , got rps 200 free cash used it to buy it for nearly free"

Not this one but my most recent bottle of the gentle cleanser smelled waaaay different in a horrifying way"
Cetaphil hydrating foaming cream cleanser,New Marcelle Hydrating Cream Cleanser,"Like others on here, I used the Marcelle Ultra Gentle Creamy Cleanser for years. So I was disappointed when Marcelle discontinued it a few months ago and skeptical of the new version they just released.

However, after trying the new one, I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. While the ingredients are different, the consistency seems almost identical to the old version. It‚Äôs a non-foaming creamy gel, very gentle and hydrating. 

My skin is sensitive (Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and LRP Toleriane sting my face; Cetaphil feels drying) but I had no irritation from the Marcelle - my skin just felt clean and comfortable, which is exactly what I want from a cleanser. (I use this as an a.m. cleanser and the second step in my p.m. cleanse).

Curious to hear other thoughts if anyone else has tried it!",https://i.redd.it/cp0zxy86plie1.jpeg,"I am very interested! I would love to replace LRP Toleriane with something cheaper and Canadian made
I bought this a week ago to replace Riversol hydrating cleanser as they changed their formula to something thinner and more drying. I really like it, I agree it works perfectly for a second cleanse at night, just leaves skin clean, but not dry at all! The price is really good too for such a large bottle. I never got to try the old formula so I can't comment on that.¬†
I love Marcelle
I really like the Marcelle brand in general. Their micellar water and 2 phase eye make up remover are 2 of my favourite things. The BB cream is lovely and they have a couple of really nice night creams.

The only thing I've tried that I was ever disappointed in is the new retinol + probiotic serum but I feel like it's the packaging that makes it suck - if it was in an airless pump it would probably be less frustrating. It's just too thick for a dropper
Everyone here was raving about the old version so I bought it at Winners the other day when I saw it lol might move on to this one after, thanks for the review!
Thanks for the review! Was looking at trying this after I run out of Cerave.¬†
I just got that cleanser a few days ago! My skin gets irritated pretty easily. It made my skin a bit red for a few minutes, but there was no burning sensation thankfully. I really like the consistency of the product and it didn‚Äôt dry out my skin.
How does it compare to the old version?
I have very dry skin and the old one felt stripping to me weirdly ?
The foaming gel was ok!
Does this cleanser remove makeup and sunscreen like an oil cleanser?
I found the old version at winners for $8 today! Lots in stock where I am
Their growth mascara is amazing too!
I‚Äôm thinking of getting this, do you still like this cleanser?
The look and feel of the new one is very similar to the old version. The ingredients are different though, so you could give it a try. I recall the old one did have salicylic acid in the ingredients (albeit low on the list), and I'm glad they didn't include that in the new version as I feel it could cause dryness.

I haven't tried the foaming one (old or new) because I prefer non-foaming cleansers.
I don‚Äôt think so. In the evening I use a cleansing balm first to remove makeup and sunscreen."
